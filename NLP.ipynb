It goes roughly like this: North Korea is the world’s most bizarre country, run by a crackpot dictator with a strange haircut. He is unpredictable and irrational and cannot be negotiated with. Eventually this weird and cruel regime will collapse. Meanwhile, the only solution is more and more pressure. But what if the conventional wisdom is wrong?</p> <p>The North Korean regime has survived for almost seven decades, preserving not just its basic form of government but also its family dynasty, <a href=\"http://time.com/4681304/north-korea-kim-family-album/\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"time.com\">father to son to grandson</a>. It has persisted through the fall of the Soviet Union and its communist satellites, the Orange Revolution, the Arab Spring and the demise of other Asian dictatorships, from South Korea to Taiwan to Indonesia.</p> <p>The Kim dynasty has been able to achieve striking success in its primary objective — survival. Of course, this is because it rules in a brutal and oppressive fashion, but so did many other regimes, such as Romania, Syria and Burma. But somehow North Korea has maintained its system.</p> <p>Kim Jong Un is a young man but has been highly effective at preserving his authority. He has secured the support of the military and sidelined or killed anyone who threatened his grip on power — including his uncle and, allegedly, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/kim-jong-uns-half-brother-was-killed-by-vx-nerve-agent-a-chemical-weapon-malaysia-police-say/2017/02/23/636c5bda-6e63-4f8e-a5dc-9f8b54f45d0e_story.html?utm_term=.955707346650\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">his half brother</a>. </p> <p>Look at the world from North Korea’s perspective. The regime saw the collapse of the Soviet empire and an even more unsettling transformation in China, which went from being a fiery ideological soul mate to a pragmatic trading state that has eagerly integrated into world markets. These days, Beijing seems to view Pyongyang as a nuisance, and China now <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-un-idUSKCN18B2OP\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.reuters.com\">often</a> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/02/531299587/u-n-security-council-unanimously-broadens-sanctions-on-north-korea\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.npr.org\">votes</a> to condemn and place sanctions against North Korea at the United Nations. </p><div class=\"inline-content inline-video\"> <div class=\"posttv-video-embed powa\" data-ad-bar=\"1\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-blurb=\"1\" data-live=\"0\" data-object-id=\"595d3e53e4b056c803ccba65\" data-org=\"wapo\" data-playthrough=\"1\" data-uuid=\"697aa258-61b8-11e7-80a2-8c226031ac3f\" data-youtube-id=\"zN4_XCbmQ2M\"> <script src=\"https://d1pz6dax0t5mop.cloudfront.net/prod/PoWaLoaderWapo.js\"></script> </div> <div class=\"inline-video-caption\"> <span class=\"pb-caption\"> (The Washington Post)</span> </div> </div> <p>And the world’s most powerful country has made clear that North Korea is destined for the ash heap of history. After 9/11, when the United States was attacked by Islamist terrorists emanating from the Middle East, President George W. Bush announced that the United States would no longer tolerate an “<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/transcripts/sou012902.htm\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">axis of evil</a>” comprising Iraq, Iran — and North Korea. It invaded Iraq. Current U.S. policy toward Iran, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/06/27/world/middleeast/ap-un-united-nations-iran-united-states.html\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.nytimes.com\">recently said</a>, is to “work toward support of those elements inside of Iran that would lead to a peaceful transition of that government.” And regarding North Korea, President Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/882062572081512449\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"twitter.com\">wants China to</a> “end this nonsense once and for all,” which again can only mean getting rid of the Kim government in some way.</p> <p>So, the North Korean regime has tried to buy insurance. And in the realm of international affairs, the best insurance is having a nuclear capacity. Pyongyang knows that it has a large-enough army and the Korean theater of war is so small and dense that a conventional war would be unthinkable, producing <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/07/north-korea-the-war-game/304029/\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.theatlantic.com\">hundreds of thousands of casualties</a> and millions of refugees pouring into China and South Korea. North Korea has accurately calculated that China and South Korea are more terrified of the chaos that would follow its collapse than of its nuclear arsenal.</p> <p>Perhaps the right way to look at North Korea is as a smart, rational, calculating government that is functioning shrewdly given its priority of regime survival. More pressure only strengthens its resolve to buy even more insurance. How to handle it under these circumstances?</p> <p>The first way to break the logjam in U.S. policy would be to persuade China to put real pressure on its ally. That won’t happen by serving President Xi Jinping chocolate cake at Mar-a-Lago. Beijing faces an understandable nightmare — under sanctions and pressure, North Korea collapses and the newly unified country becomes a giant version of South Korea, with a defense treaty with Washington, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/30/news/us-south-korea-thaad-trump-mcmaster/index.html\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"money.cnn.com\">nearly 30,000 American troops</a> and <a href=\"http://isis-online.org/isis-reports/detail/north-koreas-nuclear-capabilities-a-fresh-look\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"isis-online.org\">possibly dozens</a> of Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons — all on China’s border.</p> <p>Washington will have to promise Beijing now that in the event of unification, it would withdraw its troops, change the nature of its treaty relationship with the new Korea and, working with China, eliminate Korea’s nuclear arsenal.</p> <p>But pressure will work only if there is also some reason for North Korea to make concessions. Pyongyang <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-nuclear-idUSKCN0VU0XE\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.reuters.com\">has indicated in the past</a> that it seeks a formal end to the Korean War (Washington signed only an armistice in 1953), a recognition of the regime and the lifting of sanctions. Obviously none of this should be offered right now, but there is no harm in talking to Pyongyang and searching for ways to trade some of these concessions for the complete eradication of the nuclear program.</p> <p>It’s a bitter pill for Washington to swallow, but the alternative is to hope that China will act against its interests and crush its ally, or that North Korea will finally collapse. But hope is not a strategy.</p><div></div> <p channel=\"wp.com\"> <i>Read more from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/fareed-zakaria\">Fareed Zakaria’s archive</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fareedzakaria\">follow him on Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/fareedzakaria\">subscribe to his updates on Facebook</a>.</i> </p> <div class=\"extra\"> <p> <b>Read more on this topic:</b> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-can-trump-do-about-the-spiking-danger-from-north-korea/2017/07/05/31f8c5a2-61b4-11e7-a4f7-af34fc1d9d39_story.html?utm_term=.cb68212a28b0\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">The Post’s View: What Trump can do about North Korea</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-right-way-to-play-the-china-card-on-north-korea/2017/07/05/6d223aa0-6187-11e7-a4f7-af34fc1d9d39_story.html?utm_term=.d250706a20c1\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Jake Sullivan and Victor Cha: The right way to play the China card on North Korea</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-participated-in-talks-with-north-korean-representatives-this-is-what-we-learned/2017/06/22/8c838284-577b-11e7-ba90-f5875b7d1876_story.html?utm_term=.a3babcb38e92\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Bruce Klingner and Sue Mi Terry: We participated in talks with North Korean representatives.

       "<article itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p id=\"U12202260910680mJF\">In Washington, there is a conventional wisdom on North Korea that spans both parties and much of elite opinion. It goes roughly like this: North Korea is the world’s most bizarre country, run by a crackpot dictator with a strange haircut. He is unpredictable and irrational and cannot be negotiated with. Eventually this weird and cruel regime will collapse. Meanwhile, the only solution is more and more pressure. But what if the conventional wisdom is wrong?</p> <p>The North Korean regime has survived for almost seven decades, preserving not just its basic form of government but also its family dynasty, <a href=\"http://time.com/4681304/north-korea-kim-family-album/\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"time.com\">father to son to grandson</a>. It has persisted through the fall of the Soviet Union and its communist satellites, the Orange Revolution, the Arab Spring and the demise of other Asian dictatorships, from South Korea to Taiwan to Indonesia.</p> <p>The Kim dynasty has been able to achieve striking success in its primary objective — survival. Of course, this is because it rules in a brutal and oppressive fashion, but so did many other regimes, such as Romania, Syria and Burma. But somehow North Korea has maintained its system.</p> <p>Kim Jong Un is a young man but has been highly effective at preserving his authority. He has secured the support of the military and sidelined or killed anyone who threatened his grip on power — including his uncle and, allegedly, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/kim-jong-uns-half-brother-was-killed-by-vx-nerve-agent-a-chemical-weapon-malaysia-police-say/2017/02/23/636c5bda-6e63-4f8e-a5dc-9f8b54f45d0e_story.html?utm_term=.955707346650\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">his half brother</a>. </p> <p>Look at the world from North Korea’s perspective. The regime saw the collapse of the Soviet empire and an even more unsettling transformation in China, which went from being a fiery ideological soul mate to a pragmatic trading state that has eagerly integrated into world markets. These days, Beijing seems to view Pyongyang as a nuisance, and China now <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-un-idUSKCN18B2OP\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.reuters.com\">often</a> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/02/531299587/u-n-security-council-unanimously-broadens-sanctions-on-north-korea\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.npr.org\">votes</a> to condemn and place sanctions against North Korea at the United Nations. </p><div class=\"inline-content inline-video\"> <div class=\"posttv-video-embed powa\" data-ad-bar=\"1\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-blurb=\"1\" data-live=\"0\" data-object-id=\"595d3e53e4b056c803ccba65\" data-org=\"wapo\" data-playthrough=\"1\" data-uuid=\"697aa258-61b8-11e7-80a2-8c226031ac3f\" data-youtube-id=\"zN4_XCbmQ2M\"> <script src=\"https://d1pz6dax0t5mop.cloudfront.net/prod/PoWaLoaderWapo.js\"></script> </div> <div class=\"inline-video-caption\"> <span class=\"pb-caption\"> (The Washington Post)</span> </div> </div> <p>And the world’s most powerful country has made clear that North Korea is destined for the ash heap of history. After 9/11, when the United States was attacked by Islamist terrorists emanating from the Middle East, President George W. Bush announced that the United States would no longer tolerate an “<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/transcripts/sou012902.htm\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">axis of evil</a>” comprising Iraq, Iran — and North Korea. It invaded Iraq. Current U.S. policy toward Iran, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/06/27/world/middleeast/ap-un-united-nations-iran-united-states.html\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.nytimes.com\">recently said</a>, is to “work toward support of those elements inside of Iran that would lead to a peaceful transition of that government.” And regarding North Korea, President Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/882062572081512449\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"twitter.com\">wants China to</a> “end this nonsense once and for all,” which again can only mean getting rid of the Kim government in some way.</p> <p>So, the North Korean regime has tried to buy insurance. And in the realm of international affairs, the best insurance is having a nuclear capacity. Pyongyang knows that it has a large-enough army and the Korean theater of war is so small and dense that a conventional war would be unthinkable, producing <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/07/north-korea-the-war-game/304029/\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.theatlantic.com\">hundreds of thousands of casualties</a> and millions of refugees pouring into China and South Korea. North Korea has accurately calculated that China and South Korea are more terrified of the chaos that would follow its collapse than of its nuclear arsenal.</p> <p>Perhaps the right way to look at North Korea is as a smart, rational, calculating government that is functioning shrewdly given its priority of regime survival. More pressure only strengthens its resolve to buy even more insurance. How to handle it under these circumstances?</p> <p>The first way to break the logjam in U.S. policy would be to persuade China to put real pressure on its ally. That won’t happen by serving President Xi Jinping chocolate cake at Mar-a-Lago. Beijing faces an understandable nightmare — under sanctions and pressure, North Korea collapses and the newly unified country becomes a giant version of South Korea, with a defense treaty with Washington, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/30/news/us-south-korea-thaad-trump-mcmaster/index.html\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"money.cnn.com\">nearly 30,000 American troops</a> and <a href=\"http://isis-online.org/isis-reports/detail/north-koreas-nuclear-capabilities-a-fresh-look\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"isis-online.org\">possibly dozens</a> of Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons — all on China’s border.</p> <p>Washington will have to promise Beijing now that in the event of unification, it would withdraw its troops, change the nature of its treaty relationship with the new Korea and, working with China, eliminate Korea’s nuclear arsenal.</p> <p>But pressure will work only if there is also some reason for North Korea to make concessions. Pyongyang <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-nuclear-idUSKCN0VU0XE\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.reuters.com\">has indicated in the past</a> that it seeks a formal end to the Korean War (Washington signed only an armistice in 1953), a recognition of the regime and the lifting of sanctions. Obviously none of this should be offered right now, but there is no harm in talking to Pyongyang and searching for ways to trade some of these concessions for the complete eradication of the nuclear program.</p> <p>It’s a bitter pill for Washington to swallow, but the alternative is to hope that China will act against its interests and crush its ally, or that North Korea will finally collapse. But hope is not a strategy.</p><div></div> <p channel=\"wp.com\"> <i>Read more from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/fareed-zakaria\">Fareed Zakaria’s archive</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fareedzakaria\">follow him on Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/fareedzakaria\">subscribe to his updates on Facebook</a>.</i> </p> <div class=\"extra\"> <p> <b>Read more on this topic:</b> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-can-trump-do-about-the-spiking-danger-from-north-korea/2017/07/05/31f8c5a2-61b4-11e7-a4f7-af34fc1d9d39_story.html?utm_term=.cb68212a28b0\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">The Post’s View: What Trump can do about North Korea</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-right-way-to-play-the-china-card-on-north-korea/2017/07/05/6d223aa0-6187-11e7-a4f7-af34fc1d9d39_story.html?utm_term=.d250706a20c1\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Jake Sullivan and Victor Cha: The right way to play the China card on North Korea</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-participated-in-talks-with-north-korean-representatives-this-is-what-we-learned/2017/06/22/8c838284-577b-11e7-ba90-f5875b7d1876_story.html?utm_term=.a3babcb38e92\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Bruce Klingner and Sue Mi Terry: We participated in talks with North Korean representatives.

The North Korean regime has survived for almost seven decades, preserving not just its basic form of government but also its family dynasty, father to son to grandson. It has persisted through the fall of the Soviet Union and its communist satellites, the Orange Revolution, the Arab Spring and the demise of other Asian dictatorships, from South Korea to Taiwan to Indonesia. The Kim dynasty has been able to achieve striking success in its primary objective — survival. Of course, this is because it rules in a brutal and oppressive fashion, but so did many other regimes, such as Romania, Syria and Burma. But somehow North Korea has maintained its system. Kim Jong Un is a young man but has been highly effective at preserving his authority. He has secured the support of the military and sidelined or killed anyone who threatened his grip on power — including his uncle and, allegedly, his half brother.  Look at the world from North Korea’s perspective. The regime saw the collapse of the Soviet empire and an even more unsettling transformation in China, which went from being a fiery ideological soul mate to a pragmatic trading state that has eagerly integrated into world markets. These days, Beijing seems to view Pyongyang as a nuisance, and China now often votes to condemn and place sanctions against North Korea at the United Nations.       (The Washington Post)   And the world’s most powerful country has made clear that North Korea is destined for the ash heap of history. After 9/11, when the United States was attacked by Islamist terrorists emanating from the Middle East, President George W. Bush announced that the United States would no longer tolerate an “axis of evil” comprising Iraq, Iran — and North Korea. It invaded Iraq. Current U.S. policy toward Iran, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently said, is to “work toward support of those elements inside of Iran that would lead to a peaceful transition of that government.” And regarding North Korea, President Trump wants China to “end this nonsense once and for all,” which again can only mean getting rid of the Kim government in some way. So, the North Korean regime has tried to buy insurance. And in the realm of international affairs, the best insurance is having a nuclear capacity. Pyongyang knows that it has a large-enough army and the Korean theater of war is so small and dense that a conventional war would be unthinkable, producing hundreds of thousands of casualties and millions of refugees pouring into China and South Korea. North Korea has accurately calculated that China and South Korea are more terrified of the chaos that would follow its collapse than of its nuclear arsenal. Perhaps the right way to look at North Korea is as a smart, rational, calculating government that is functioning shrewdly given its priority of regime survival. More pressure only strengthens its resolve to buy even more insurance. How to handle it under these circumstances? The first way to break the logjam in U.S. policy would be to persuade China to put real pressure on its ally. That won’t happen by serving President Xi Jinping chocolate cake at Mar-a-Lago. Beijing faces an understandable nightmare — under sanctions and pressure, North Korea collapses and the newly unified country becomes a giant version of South Korea, with a defense treaty with Washington, nearly 30,000 American troops and possibly dozens of Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons — all on China’s border. Washington will have to promise Beijing now that in the event of unification, it would withdraw its troops, change the nature of its treaty relationship with the new Korea and, working with China, eliminate Korea’s nuclear arsenal. But pressure will work only if there is also some reason for North Korea to make concessions. Pyongyang has indicated in the past that it seeks a formal end to the Korean War (Washington signed only an armistice in 1953), a recognition of the regime and the lifting of sanctions. Obviously none of this should be offered right now, but there is no harm in talking to Pyongyang and searching for ways to trade some of these concessions for the complete eradication of the nuclear program. It’s a bitter pill for Washington to swallow, but the alternative is to hope that China will act against its interests and crush its ally, or that North Korea will finally collapse.

       "'      This color-coded map displays a progression of changing global surface temperature anomalies from 1880 through 2015. Higher than normal temperatures are shown in red and lower then normal temperatures are shown in blue. (NASA)   How much Earth will warm in response to future greenhouse gas emissions may be one of the most fundamental questions in climate science —\\xa0but it’s also one of the most difficult to answer. And it’s growing more controversial: In recent years, some scientists have suggested that our climate models may actually be predicting too much future\\xa0warming, and that climate change will be less severe than the projections suggest. But\\xa0new research is helping lay these suspicions to rest. A study, out Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, joins a growing body of literature that suggests the models are on track after all. And while that may be worrisome for the planet, it’s good news for the scientists working to understand its future. The new study addresses a basic conflict between what the models suggest about future climate change and what we can infer from historical observations alone. Some scientists have suggested that the models may be too sensitive, pointing out that the warming they predict for the future is greater than what we would expect\\xa0based only on the warming patterns we’ve observed since humans began emitting greenhouse gases.   [A trillion-ton iceberg the size of Delaware is about to break off Antarctica]   The models, for instance, suggest that if the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere were to reach\\xa0double its preindustrial level, the planet would warm by anywhere from about 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius\\xa0(2.7 to 8.1 Fahrenheit). But the warming patterns we’ve actually observed over the past 200 years or so would suggest that a doubling in carbon dioxide should only lead to about 3 degrees Celsius\\xa0(5.4 Fahrenheit) of warming at the most. The discrepancy has become a major cause for concern among climate scientists in recent years, according to the new study’s lead author Cristian Proistosescu, a research associate at the University of Washington who conducted the research while completing a PhD at Harvard. Even the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change acknowledged the issue in its most recent report, he said, stating that it could no longer provide a best estimate for the climate’s sensitivity. “It worried a lot of us,” Proistosescu told The Washington Post. “We needed to understand why our different estimates didn’t work.” The new study helps reconcile the models with the historical record. It suggests global warming occurs in different phases or “modes” throughout the planet, some of which happen more quickly than others. Certain slow-developing\\xa0climate processes could amplify warming to a greater extent in the future, putting the models in the right after all.\\xa0But these processes take time, even up to several hundred years, to really take effect — and because not enough time has passed since the Industrial Revolution for their signal to really develop, the historical record is what’s actually misleading at the moment. This conclusion is supported by a growing body of research, which suggests that warming estimates made from the historical record alone are “potentially biased low, for reasons we are now just beginning to understand,” said\\xa0Timothy Andrews, a climate scientist with the Met Office, the United Kingdom’s national weather service, in an email to The Washington Post. While Andrews was not involved with the new study, he’s one of multiple scientists whose recent research has tackled the same issue. The new study uses a statistical method to\\xa0separate “fast” and “slow” climate modes in the models. According to Proistosescu, when greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere, a “fast” warming effect begins to take place almost immediately in certain parts of the planet, mainly over the land masses in the Northern Hemisphere. Indeed, these are the parts of Earth\\xa0where the most rapid warming has been observed since the Industrial Revolution.   [EPA chief pushing governmentwide effort to question climate change science]   On the other hand, he said, other parts of the planet —\\xa0namely, the Southern Ocean and the eastern Pacific —\\xa0respond much more slowly, in part because they’re just so deep and cold to begin with. But as they absorb more heat and finally start to warm up, they may produce a variety of climate feedback effects that enhance the global warming that’s already occurring. For instance, changes in ocean temperatures can alter atmospheric patterns around the world. The models suggest that these warming ocean regions may lead to a decrease in reflective cloud cover in the future, allowing more solar radiation to make it through the atmosphere to Earth’s surface. While the impact of these processes may be profound, they can also take long periods of time to unfold, Proistosescu said — potentially up to 300 years or so. Through their statistical parsing, the researchers found that the models suggest the effects of this slow climate mode only account for about 3 percent of the human-caused warming we’ve seen so far. But in the future, under a scenario in which atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations double, it could account for up to half of all warming that occurs. Since they were able to separate the fast and slow climate modes, the researchers also conducted a test to see what would happen if they only\\xa0applied fast climate warming in the models. When they did so, the model predictions suddenly fell in line with the historical record — suggesting that the still-developing slow mode is the reason the two have failed to match so far. That said, the study does beg the question of how we can be so sure the slow climate mode will actually develop\\xa0as it does in the model, since humans have yet to really observe it in nature. According to Piers Forster, a University of Leeds climate scientist who has also studied climate sensitivity, the models tend to rely on certain assumptions that have not yet unfolded in real life — for instance, that the eastern Pacific will eventually warm to a greater extent than the western Pacific. “This doesn’t necessarily mean the models are wrong,” he added in an emailed comment to The Washington Post. But, he said, it does suggest that “we do not yet fully understand these long term changes in the Pacific and therefore these climate change amplification effects.” According to Proistosescu, some studies of Earth’s ancient climate —\\xa0which scientists can conduct using information from sources like ice cores and preserved sediments —\\xa0do suggest that a slow climate mode does exist and has occurred in the past. And he added that the climate models rely on basic physical processes to a great extent, and “we trust that they do the basic physics correctly.” But he agreed that some caution — or at least a great deal more research on how these slow climate responses\\xa0will continue to develop — is called for. In fact, identifying the uncertainties that remain about Earth’s climate sensitivity is another significant outcome of the study, he suggested. The research indicates that the models and the historical record are not so different after all, and that there are certain large-scale climate feedback processes still unfolding. How exactly those develop may still be uncertain — no one’s arguing that the models are currently perfect, Proistosescu\\xa0said. “But they’re\\xa0close enough that you trust that there is an effect there, you just need to better quantify what that is,”\\xa0he added. “And that’s\\xa0where a lot of the work is going.” Read more at Energy & Environment: These experts say we have three years to get climate change under control.

The Vision Fund closed a few days ago with $93 billion in initial commitments, and already venture firms from London to Silicon Valley are fretting about a behemoth with the resources,cloutand name recognition to snatch away the most promising deals. Just last week, SoftBank swooped in and pumped $1.4 billion into Paytm, Indias largestdigital-paymentsstartup. The deal boosted Paytm's valuation by about 40 percent to $7 billion. That's not outlandish givenPaytm'sdominant market position, but the valuations of other SoftBank deals have prompted head-scratching and ignited alarm that a funding atmosphere that only recently cooled off will heat up again. there's the concern that SoftBank will ladle out more money than startups need or can absorb. Already founders approached by SoftBank are caught between the desire to take the money and concern about handing over too much control of their company, according to an investor. One startup targeted by SoftBank has tried to negotiate for less money, this person says. SoftBank won't budge; it's a big check or nothing. SoFi originally asked for less money, too, according to another investor. Pushing startups to take more cash than they ask for has been Son's strategy since the beginning. SoftBank invested more money in Yahoo,Alibabaand Didi than what the entrepreneurs had initially wanted.\",\n",

And its not going to let video giants or startups disrupt its future.This week Quora began testing video answers, because sometimes its a lot easier to show someone how something works, the best way to complete a task, or why one thing is better than another than try to write it out for them. Users in the beta group will be able to record videos on iOS or Android as supplements or complete answers that everyone on Quora can watch. Its considering allowing video uploads, which might offer more polished content but increase spam concerns. Previously, Quora only let users answer with text, natively hosted photos, links, and embedded videos from platforms like YouTube. Now its actively hosting and soliciting video uploads. Quoras entry intothe spacecould box out younger competitors like Justin Kans mobile video Q&A app Whale, and video Ask Me AnythingappYam. These apps are focused entirely on simplifying the process of recording video answers to questions with features like filters to make you look better, and both give creators ways to earn money.But Quoras 190 million users, $226 million in funding, and 8-year headstartgive it a big edge. Its been cautiously curating a network of experts andcontent,while building a brand name known for quality in contrast to its predecessor Yahoo Answers. Its network effect may be tough to break.',\n",

When Uber picked this former Rust Belt town as the inaugural city for its driverless car experiment, Pittsburgh played the consummate host.You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet, Bill Peduto, the mayor of Pittsburgh, said in September. If you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet.Nine months later, Pittsburgh residents and officials say Uber has not lived up to its end of the bargain. Among Ubers perceived transgressions: The company began charging for driverless rides that were initially pitched as free. It also withdrew support from Pittsburghs application for a $50 million federal grant to revamp transportation. And it has not created the jobs it proposed in a struggling neighborhood that houses its autonomous car testing track. The deteriorating relationship between Pittsburgh and Uber offers a cautionary tale, especially as other cities consider rolling out driverless car trials from Uber, AlphabetsWaymoand others.',\n",

The company\\'s current headcount in the U.S. is over 500, according to this person. LeEco started out in China as a streaming media provider  it has been referred to as the \"Netflix of China\"  and looked to expand into the US by selling affordable hardware that linked consumers to media content from LeEco\\'s partners. Its first batch of products included two smartphones and several TVs, all of which offered flagship-level specs at affordable prices. The idea, it seemed, was that LeEco would make its money back when consumers tuned in to partner programming. When it made its debut in the US in October 2016, it also promised more, including VR headsets and an electric bicycle.',\n",
       " b'Why Did a Chinese Peroxide Company Pay $1 Billion for a Talking Cat?Even by the opaque standards of Chinese mergers and acquisitions, the deal was a head-scratcher. Its hard to see the synergies between a maker of chemical solvents and a digital cat perched over a toilet. And curiously, the buyer, which had recently been renamed Zhejiang Jinke Entertainment Culture Co., had revenue of only $133 million in 2016, according to Bloomberg data pulled from regulatory filings, and its gross profit was $55 million.Jinkewont say where the money to buy Outfit7 came from. Talking Tom is not alone. Theres been a recent flurry of oddball pairings between Chinese industrial interests and Western entertainment companies. A real estate magnate in Beijing bought Legendary Entertainment, the movie studio that made the Dark Knight trilogy, for $3.5 billion. A maker of construction materials bought Framestore, the company behind the special effects in the Harry Potter films. Zhejiang Dragon Pipe Manufacturing Co. acquired app developer Entertainment Game Labs. And perhaps strangest of all, Digital Extremes Ltd., which created an alien battle game, and the studio Splash Damage Ltd., which made an offshoot of the Xbox hit Gears of War, were bought by an enormous Chinese poultry processor.According to CODE Advisors LLC, an investment bank that specializes in media and technology deals, 70 percent of all acquisitions of game companies since 2015 have been by Chinese buyers. Samo, for one, isnt stopping to ask questions. A vegan, hes using his windfall to start a food-sustainability foundation. Its not easy, he says, to find buyers for a $1 billion company. The deal activity can best be understood as a consequence of quirks in the Chinese stock market. In China, industrial companies trade at valuations theyd never receive elsewhere in the world. Affan Butt, an investment banker who helped facilitate the sale of Jagex, says some may trade at as much as 100 times their annual earningsmore than four times the multiple of General Electric Co. This means they can acquire companies at what is effectively a discount. A target like Jagex is worth more once its part of a Chinese-listed company, allowing the acquirer to pay prices that appear bafflingly high to the rest of the world.',\n",
       " b\"Thanks! or Thanks.? Google will tailor suggested email replies to your preferences.If you use Google's Gmail app, you may have seen something new pop up on your screen this week: suggested responses for your emails.The move illustrates one way that Google is using its increased focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. If you're wondering why and how Google can make these suggestions, here are some answers about the feature and how it works. Google calls the feature Smart Reply, and its pretty much what it sounds like. Google algorithms are scanning your messages and using the information it gleans to suggest ways that you could reply to any given message. Smart Reply relies on machine learning to scan the subject line and body of an email and make suggestions based on what it sees. The company said it has built up a huge bank of anonymized customer messages and response decisions to help accomplish this.It is also designed to remember your individual preferences for things, such as punctuation. So it will be able to adjust its suggestions depending on whether you're a Thanks! or Thanks. type of person.Smart Replies won't appear on every email though, Google said. You're most likely to see response suggestions on emails that can be easily answered with a simple sentence or two.\",\n",

Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, chairman of Softbank, a telecommunications and tech investment group, revealed plans for the fund last October and since then it has obtained commitments from some of the world's most deep-pocketed investors. In addition to Softbank and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), the new fund's investors include Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment, which has committed $15 billion, Apple Inc, Qualcomm, Taiwan's Foxconn Technology and Japan's Sharp Corp.The new fund made its announcement during the visit of President Donald Trump to Riyadh and the signing of tens of billions of dollars worth of business deals between U.S. and Saudi companies. Son was also in Riyadh on Saturday.After meeting with Trump last December, Son pledged $50 billion of investment in the United States that would create 50,000 jobs, a promise Trump claimed was a direct result of his election win.The fund may also serve the interests of Saudi Arabia by helping Riyadh obtain access to foreign technology. The Saudi economy has been severely damaged by low oil prices, and policymakers are trying to diversify into new industries.\",\n",

The shares dropped the most in almost a year.Chinas biggest e-commerce company posted adjusted earnings-per-share of 4.35 yuan, missing the 4.51 yuan average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That came even as revenue rose at a faster-than-expected 60 percent to 38.6 billion yuan ($5.6 billion). Core commerce revenue surged 47 percent to 31.57 billion yuan with the business delivering operating income of 16.5 billion yuan, the company said.While cloud unit revenue doubled in the March quarter to 2.2 billion yuan, the business had an operating loss of 505 million yuan as it slashes prices to snatch market share from Amazon.com Inc. and Tencent. Revenue from digital entertainment more than tripled to 3.9 billion yuan with an operating loss of 2.6 billion yuan as it spends on content for video site Youku Tudou and other platforms.

The deal includes $400 million worth of shares that SoftBank will buy largely from Paytms early investor SAIF Partners in a secondary transaction, and a minor stake from founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma, according to two persons close to the development.The deal values the company at about $7 billion post-money (including the investment) and will take SoftBanks stake to about 20%, the two people said, requesting anonymity. Paytm, Indias second-most valuable internet firm, will use the money to acquire 500 million new customers and launch a slew of financial services products such as wealth management, insurance and deposits and loans.This business will require a lot of capital before it can start generating cash and hence we need long-term investors like SoftBank and Alibaba, founder Sharma said in a telephone interview.',\n",
       " b'Walmart Reports 63% Rise in Online Sales:On Thursday, the company said e-commerce sales had grown 63 percent in the United States in the latest quarter. The unexpected leap offered the strongest evidence yet that Walmart, the countrys largest retailer, is making headway in its effort to be as prominent online as it is across the American landscape. Walmarts latest strategy, put in place by its current chief executive, Doug McMillon, has several parts: expand the number of products available online, better leverage its huge physical warehouses and distribution centers to reach customers quickly across the country, and aggressively pursue deals for online stores.The biggest of those deals, in which Walmart paid $3.3 billion for the bulk e-commerce retailer Jet.com last year, was part of the plan to offer customers more products through the web.The earnings results on Thursday gave only hints of about how much the acquisitions gave the company a one-time bump in sales, rather than long-lasting fruit from other changes the company has made. Comparable-store sales, one measure of growth that looks at stores that have been open for at least a year, rose 1.4 percent. That number includes Walmarts core online business, but not items sold through Jet.com.Walmart completed its purchase of Jet in September. Smaller digital acquisitions followed, including ModCloth, a womens clothing retailer, and the outdoor apparel site Moosejaw.The deal for Jet was also widely seen as a play for its founder, Marc Lore, a serial digital entrepreneur who could help fix Walmarts online strategy. Mr. Lore was put in charge of running Walmart.com after the acquisition, spearheading the face-off between the worlds largest brick-and-mortar retailer and its biggest online competitor.',\n",

The stock had closed down 1.4 percent in regular trading, compared with the 1.78 percent slump in the index. Revenue in its closely-watched security business, which offers firewall protection and breach detection systems, rose 9 percent to $527 million, but missed analysts' estimate of $545.5 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet Street Account. Cisco, like other legacy technology players, is shifting its focus to high-growth areas such as security, the Internet of Things and cloud computing, amid intense competition from companies such as Huawei and Juniper.The company's net income rose to $2.52 billion, or 50 cents per share, in the third quarter ended April 29 from $2.35 billion, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier.Revenue fell 0.5 percent to $11.94 billion.\",\n",
       " b\"Square Will Replace Meters in Washington Taxis:Washington, D.C., is enlisting Square Inc.s help as its taxi commission tries to help the citys cabbies compete with Uber drivers. By the end of August, all of the taxis in Washington have to tear out their traditional meters and start using smartphones or tablets, in what the city government has been describing as a complete reimagining of how the cab system works.For Square, the deal reflects an increasing focus on becoming the payment platform for a range of other company's mobile applications, websites and point-of-sale devices. No money is changing hands between the company and the city. Square agreed to satisfy the departments requirement that drivers give up no more than 2.65 percent of their fares in transaction fees, according to the department. Thats lower than the standard 2.75 commission it usually takes and significantly less than the 3.5 percent to 5 percent commission that drivers currently pay to use the mechanical meters, according to ErnestChrappah, the director of the city's taxi regulator. Chrappah said the lower fees will help make it easier for cabbies to sustain themselves. But the bigger changes come in the increased flexibility that taxi drivers will have once theyre untethered from mechanical meters. There wont be a single taxi app. Instead, the department is asking developers to build apps, which it will then certify for use by licensed taxi drivers. It is currently working with seven developers, who will make their apps public between now the deadline to replace the meters. It will continue to consider adding new apps as developers pitch them. All of the certified apps must be able to operate as meters for street hails. Theyll also be able to provide digital receipts showing the route they took and give riders the option to rate drivers. Developers can also build services like carpooling or delivery systems that will connect drivers to local merchants looking for people to drop off food, groceries or other products. A developer could build an Uber clone, creating a way to connect drivers to passengers requesting rides through an app. The exact contours of these services will become clear as the individual developers release their software.Taxis will also be able to offer dynamic pricing, where drivers can give discounts during periods when they have trouble securing fares. This resembles Ubers practice of charging more when demand rises as a way to coax drivers onto the road, only in reverse. Drivers wont have the option to increase their fares.\",\n",
       " b'As self-driving cars hit the road, real estate development may takenewdirection:The much-hyped transition to autonomous cars, while still years, or even decades, away, according to experts, is an opportunity and challenge that haswidepotential to reshape our transportation systems.But many believe that as city planners, transportation officials, and, eventually, developers start grappling with the changes to come, autonomous vehicles potential to reshape real estate, development, and city planning will rival that of the introduction of the automobile. At the American Planning Associations annual conference earlier this month in New York City, the issue of autonomous vehicles and driverless cars, one admittedly far in the future, was the subject of numerous present-day panels, discussions, and debates. [An expert] sees two small but significant changes affecting urban real estate development in the age of driverless cars. A reduced need for parking may be the most significant. High-value property in urban areas needs to account for mandatory parking allowances, forcing developers to factor the cost of parking spaces into construction costs and rent. Local government will need to act decisively to regulate drop-off lanes, speeds, and new parking rules before market forces, and other governments, begin making decisions for them. Technology firms shouldnt reap the rewards after cities make the investments necessary to adapt to a new transportation reality.',\n",
       " b'Uber Engineer Barred From Work on Key Self-Driving Technology, Judge Says:Uber, the ride-hailing company, sidestepped a full shutdown of its self-driving car efforts on Monday when a federal judge stopped short of issuing a temporary injunction against the program.But the court mandated that Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer leading the program, be prohibited from working on a critical component of autonomous vehicle technology for the duration of the litigation, a setback that could hamper Ubers development efforts.The decision was in a case that has underlined the increasingly bitter fight between Uber andWaymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Googles parent company. The companies have been competing in the development of autonomous vehicles, which many consider the future of transportation. The outcome of the case may affect who wins or loses in the technology, which has also drawn other tech companies,automakersand start-ups. In the ruling on Monday, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco, said, WaymoL.L.C. has shown compelling evidence that its former star engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 confidential files fromWaymoimmediately before leaving his employment there.He added, Significantly, the evidence indicates that, during the acquisition, Uber likely knew or at least should have known that Levandowski had taken and retained possession ofWaymosconfidential files.Judge Alsup also ruled thatWaymosignificantly overreached when it asked for protection on more than 120 patents it called trade secrets.General approaches dictated by well-known principles of physics, however, are not secret, since they consist essentially of general engineering principles that are simply part of the intellectual equipment of technical employees, Judge Alsup wrote. He directed Uber to produce a timeline of the events leading to Mr. Levandowskis hiring, including all oral and written discussions between the parties about an important self-driving technology called lidar, short for light detection and ranging, which Mr. Levandowski has been accused of stealing. The judge also ordered Uber to do what it could to ensure the return of the files toWaymo, including the possibility of terminating Mr. Levandowskis employment at Uber.Despite the judges ruling on Mr. Levandowski, Uber also had cause for celebration because its self-driving research program was not shut down, which would have been a more serious blow.',\n",
       " b'Hardly Anyone Paying the Hackers? Because Using Bitcoin Is Hard:An unprecedented cyberattack swept across the globe over the weekend, but so far the majority of victims havent paid hackers a ransom.After the ransomware began infecting users on Friday, they were given 72 hours to pay $300 in bitcoin -- chosen by the hackers because thecrypto currencyis harder to track than conventional payments -- or pay twice as much. If they refused to pay after seven days, their computer would be permanently locked -- a serious problem for those who havent backed up their data.As of early Monday, only about $50,000 had been paid in ransoms, according to Elliptic Enterprises Ltd., a London-based company that tracks illicit use of bitcoin. The company calculated the total based on payments tracked to bitcoin addresses specified in the ransom demands, adding that it expects the total to rise. Paying a ransom isnt like buying something from Amazon by entering their credit or debit card information. Even though the hackers provided a helpful link for those new to paying in bitcoin, thecrypto currencyis a black box for most people.\"If youre presented with something that says pay this amount in bitcoin, most people dont know where to start with that,\" said James Smith, theCEOand co-founder of Elliptic.There are several steps. First, a person or business has to obtain the bitcoins by registering with one of the various online exchanges and going through its verification process. After that, money can be deposited into the exchange. For those living in countries that dont have an exchange, including the U.K., money must be converted into another currency.Once the money is deposited on the exchange, the bitcoins can be sent to the address provided by the extortionist. \"It looks like a long garbled string of text,\" Smith said. After the fee is paid, the hackers supposedly free the affected computer.\"A large amount of bitcoin is actually somewhat difficult to source quickly,\" said Alex Sunnarborg, an analyst at bitcoin research company CoinDesk, adding it might take a few days to create an account at a bitcoin brokerage or exchange, connect a bank account, and then receive the bitcoin.One notable difference with this attack is that the perpetrators demanded a relatively small amount of money but from a large number of people, said James Chappell, chief technology officer and co-founder of U.K. security company Digital Shadows.More typically, he said, hackers demand one large ransom to unlock all the infected machines. \"Quite often theyre in the thousands rather than the hundreds of dollars,\" he said. \"It is unusual to see this piecemeal approach, computer by computer.\"',\n",
       " b'Extortionists Mount Global Hacking Attack Seeking Ransom:Extortionist hackers who may be using leaked computer exploits from the U.S. National Security Agency infiltrated computers in dozens of countries in a fast-spreading attack that forced British hospitals to turn away patients and breached systems at Spains Telefonica SA and organizations from Russia to Taiwan.The ransomware used in Fridays cyber-attacks encrypts files and demands that victims pay $300 in bitcoin for them to be decrypted, the latest in a vexing style of security breaches that, at the very least, forces organizations to revert to backup systems to keep critical systems running. The malicious software has infected more than 75,000 computers in 99 countries worldwide on Friday, most of them concentrated in Russia,Ukraineand Taiwan, according to Dutch cybersecurity company Avast Software BV. While the victim tally is likely to grow, the ransomware, called WanaCrypt0r, only affects computers that havent applied Microsofts two-month-old fix, a reminder that individuals and organizations that dont routinely update their machines are vulnerable. Hospitals are notoriously slow in applying security fixes, in part because of how disruptive it is to take patient-facing equipment and databases offline. That has made them a reliable target of ransomware and identity-theft attacks, and why they routinely fall victim even to random mass attacks.',\n",
       " b\"Alphabets self-driving unitWaymois teaming up withLyft:Waymo, the self-driving unit of Google parent company Alphabet, is teaming up with Lyft to work on bringing autonomous vehicle efforts to market, the New York Times reports. Details on what this partnership entails remain a little fuzzy, but sources told Times reporter Mike Isaac the two companies would be working together on pilot projects and product development efforts. That's another way of saying Lyft users in some markets will likely be able to hail aWaymoself-driving car in a limited test sometime down the road. This is not Lyfts only partnership aimed at bringing self-driving technology into the mainstream. Lyft has a partnership with GM, which last year acquired self-driving startup Cruise.Alphabetwas also experimenting with its own ride-hailing app  which the company has been using in its first pilot program in Arizona. But it's not likely the company would solely depend on either that app or the ride-matching service Waze, another Alphabet subsidiary, has been experimenting with to give consumers access to self-driving cars.

The relationship between Uber and Alphabet has gone from tense to combative in the past year.

Founded in 2000 by high-school dropout Bang Jun-hyuk, Netmarble is a rare entrepreneurial success in a nation dominated by politically connected manufacturing conglomerates. Betting smartphones would drive gaming, Bang built the company into one of Asias largest publishers of mobile titles such as Lineage 2Revolution,and won backing from Chinas Tencent Holdings Ltd. A successful debut could inspire a generation of talent in a country whose conglomerates have been accused of stifling innovation. Investors bought in despite the stock trading at valuations well above its rivals: Netmarble was priced at more than 70 times 2016 earnings, surpassing NCSoft Corp.s roughly 29 times and Nexon Co.s 45 times as of Thursdays close. It also faces stiffening competition, with NCSoft releasing a role-playing series this year to directly challenge Lineage 2 Revolution.',\n",
       " b'How Australia Bungled Its $36 Billion High-Speed Internet Rollout:Australia, a wealthy nation with a widely envied quality of life, lags in one essential area of modern life: its internet speed. Eight years after the country began an unprecedented broadband modernization effort that will cost at least 49 billion Australian dollars, or $36 billion, its average internet speed lags that of the United States, most of Western Europe, Japan and South Korea. In the most recent ranking of internet speeds by Akamai, a networking company, Australia came in at an embarrassing No. 51, trailing developing economies like Thailand and Kenya.Australia was the first country where a totally national plan to cover every house or business was considered, said Rod Tucker, a University of Melbourne professor and a member of the expert panel that advised on the effort. The fact it was a government plan didnt necessarily make it doomed. In Australia, we have changes of governments every three years, which really works against the ability to undertake long-term planning, and the long-term rollouts of networks like this.Australia poses natural connectivity challenges. It lies oceans away from other countries, and any network would have to connect far-flung cities separated by its sparsely populated interior.Still, Australia had high hopes for its ambitious internet project. Started in 2009, the initiative, known as the National Broadband Network, was intended to bring advanced fiber-optic technology to the doorstep of just about every home and business. It was initially estimated to cost 43 billion Australian dollars, shared by the government and the private sector. But the government share of those costs quickly climbed until taxpayers were responsible for all of it. The technology was slow to roll out, in part because of negotiations with Telstra, Australias big telecommunications provider, over installing the fiber. (A Telstra spokesman said the company did not believe the talks added to delays.) The government-funded effort drew fire from the Liberal Party, the opposition at the time, which said the job should have been left to the private sector.After a Liberal-led coalition was elected in 2013, that party looked for ways to contain costs and speed up the rollout. They focused on what in the telecommunications industry is called the last mile  the wires that connect a home or business with the broader network. While the National Broadband Network initially envisioned high-speed fiber connecting homes and businesses directly to the network, the Liberal-led effort compromised by connecting them with existing copper wire  basically, the same technology used in the earliest days of the telephone. The result, critics say, was slow speeds that still did not stop rising costs.',\n",
       " b'The Risk in Using a Public Phone Charger:Can a phone really get hacked by plugging it into a public USB charging station?A. If you have ever backed up your phones contents by plugging into the computer, you have seen how the USB port can transfer data as well as charge the devices battery. The concept of juice-jacking has been proved at hacker conventions and seen in the wild, and it is definitely possible to transfer malicious software with a phone through a USB connection  perhaps from a computer or device concealed within a public charging station, like those found in airports or malls.If you are traveling and are concerned about keeping your phones battery charged, bring your own USB cable and AC adapter so you can plug right into a regular power outlet. The Wirecutter, aproduct-recommendationsite owned by The Times, has suggestions for USB battery packs to bring along when you expect to be away from an outlet for long periods of time. Other solutions for protecting your phone include taking (or making) a power-only USB cable that lacks the internal wiring needed to transfer data. If you do not have one of those cables, power off the device before you plug it into a public charging port (although this is not a foolproof solution for every phone model out there).Last year, the Federal Trade Commission warned consumers against connecting a personal smartphone to the entertainment system through a USB port or Bluetooth wireless link in a rental car. This is because the dashboard software can import and store data from your phone, like your call logs, messages, contacts and locations you requested from the GPS software.',\n",

Revenue was also down from the fourth quarter of 2016, a seasonally stronger period for adsales,when it was $166 million.Revenue was \"a relatively disappointing number,\" Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said. \"To their credit,\" he added, \"they did guide towards a number that would be lower, which it was.\"Average revenue per user was 90 cents in the first quarter, Snap said, up from 33 cents the same quarter a year earlier but below the $1.05 per user in the fourth quarter of 2016.Snap\\'s net loss widened to $2.21 billion, or $2.31 per share, in the first quarter, from $104.6 million, or 14 cents per share, due to stock-based compensation related to the IPO.Although the figure of $2 billion in total stock-based compensation was known ahead of time, investors were surprised to see all of it show up in a single quarter rather than spread out over time, said Eric Kim, managing partner at Goodwater Capital.\"It is an eye-popping number for sure,\" he said.',\n",
       " b'As Department Stores Close, Stitch Fix Expands Online:The retail landscape is littered with the casualties of changing consumer behavior. Shoppers are bargain hunting online, department stores are struggling, and once-mainstay brands are closing out permanently.Then there is Stitch Fix, a mail-order clothing service that offers customerslittlechoice in what garments theyreceive,and shies away from discounts for brand name dresses,pantsand accessories.Despite a business model that seems to defy conventional wisdom, Stitch Fix continues to grow.For the fiscal year that ended last July, the company recorded sales of $730 million. It has been profitable since 2014 and has raised just $42 million from outside investors, a relatively modest sum for a high-flying Silicon Valley start-up.Stitch Fixs pitch is straightforward enough: Trust the company to pick out your tops, bottoms, shoes or accessories for you.When customers sign up, they fill out an extensive form detailing style preferences, clothingneedsand price points. The start-ups algorithms then churn out a set of potential choices, which one of its 3,400 stylists  most of them part time  then tailors to the individual customer before sending out five items in a package. Anything a customer does not want can be returned free of charge, and customers receive a 25 percent discount when they buy everything in the box.Stitch Fix is not the first company to try this business model. Similar start-ups, from clothing rival Trunk Club to the cosmetics specialist Birchbox, have found a market mailing consumers a grab bag of items and offering free returns for anything unwanted.But many such start-ups have had trouble keeping costs down, and customers around. Nordstrom, which bought Trunk Club in 2014 for a reported $350 million, wrote down nearly $200 million from the business value last year.',\n",

       " b'Snapchat has almost as many teens as Facebook, despite being an eighth of its size:Snapchats narrative has consistently been one of quality over quantity.Unlike Facebook, it isnt aiming to sign up the whole world, but rather those in developed nations with expensive smartphones. Instead of focusing on huge subscriber numbers, Snapchat parent Snap touts its fervent user base. Its daily active users visit the app more than 18 times each day, according to its S-1 filing.Most importantly to a company that relies on ads for revenue, Snapchat bills itself as an app for the young  catnip for advertisers trying to reach hard-to-find millennials.Ahead of its first quarterly earnings report since going public in March, just how popular is Snapchat among young people? Not as popular as Facebook, but very impressive considering how much smaller it is. According to data from research firm eMarketer, 59 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds, 68 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds and 42 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds use the app at least once per month each month throughout the year.Facebooks numbers for those age groups are 64, 77 and 81 percent, respectively. Facebook has 1.3 billion daily active users while Snapchat has just an eighth of that at 158 million.Instagram, too, boasts a lot of users in those young age groups, though Snapchat has a much tighter hold on 12- to 17-year-old future consumers than Facebooks Instagram nearly four times as many. And again, Instagram is more than twice as big with 400 million daily active users.',\n",

In the fourth quarter (reported in February), Yelp said net revenue was expected to be in the range of $880 million to $900 million. That means even though the companys revenue fell only a little short of what Wall Street was expecting, the company is signaling slower growth than expected. Yelp has seen slowing revenue growth for some time now. If the company itself isparingback its growth expectations, that means its trying to set some model closer to reality for Wall Street  which is inevitably going to make industry observers reset their ownmodels,and the valuation for the company along with it. Before todays fall off a cliff, Yelp was valued at around $2.8 billion.',\n",

The speakers feature Alexa, Amazon's voice-controlled aide, which users can tell to play music, order an Uber or turn on the house lights.That puts it far ahead of Alphabet Inc's Google Home, a similar gadget that has a 23.8 percent share, and less successful offerings from other tech companies. The number of active U.S. users will more than double for the devices this year, to 35.6 million, eMarketer said.The report underscores Amazon's progress in making Alexa and its speech-recognition technology an integral part of customers' lives. More usersmeansmore data that can improve Alexa's understanding and could make it a top platform forvoice,like Windows is fordesktop.Amazon does not disclose Echo sales figures but has said it had trouble keeping the product in stock. Device sales and extra revenue from shoppers placing orders via Alexa could generate $10 billion for Amazon by 2020, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a recent note. And that does not include potential revenue from others using Alexa as a platform. Google's share is expected to grow, though. Tests by analysts have shown the technology underpinning the Google Home to match or be superior to competitors. A survey by Mahaney found the device's brand awareness in the United States already equaled 80 percent of Alexa's, despite being on the market for fewer months.\",\n",

He hada Ouijaboard in his lap and waslivestreamingthe experience to a group of fans on YouTube. Youre not ever supposed to do Ouija alone, let alone in a place that had an exorcism done in it, he said to the empty room. As he filmed last month, the comments rolled in, some admiring (You are one brave ghost hunter), others fearing for his safety (Tim, dont summon what u cant banish). Mr. Wood, 39, has amassed a small but loyal following by making online videos of ghost hunts and paranormal activity, using YouTube to broadcast his work since about 2013. Automatically placed advertisements on his channel, LiveScifi, which has about 470,000 subscribers, have allowed him to turn the videos into a full-time job.But in the wake of a recent advertiser exodus from YouTube, prompted by major brands discovering they were showing up on videos promoting hate speech and terrorism, his earnings have plunged. Mr. Wood, who lives in San Francisco with his fiance and their infant, said his channel had brought in at least $6,000 a month in revenue last year  which helped pay for travel to site locations, the production of his videos and his other day-to-day bills. In January, his estimated revenue was about $3,900. In February and March, he was alarmed to see that drop below $3,000. Last month, he saw around $1,600 and has been using crowdfunding to cover his shooting costs.In February and March, a slew of advertisers yanked their money from the platform, prompting YouTube to tighten its default settings for where ads appear and to offer new ways for brands to manually and automatically avoid material that violates its guidelines. Rates are a lot lower and hurting a lot of folks, said Krishna Subramanian, a founder of Captiv8, a firm that connects brands to social media influencers. His firm recently conducted a survey of 100 YouTube creators and said that channels focused on comedy and gaming experienced the sharpest drops in revenue last month compared with February. At the same time, creators in food,beautyand fashion, and family and parenting hadincreases. YouTube shares ad revenue with creators, who keep more than half.Some creators are looking at a video saying, It got a million views, but I only got $700  I used to get $2,500, Mr. Subramanian said.',\n",

The billionaire said this week that he cut about a third of his stake in IBM, sending the shares down 2.5 percent Friday.Buffett and Vice Chairman Charles Munger built Berkshire into one of the worlds largest companies with bets on consumer-product companies like Coca-Cola Co. and older industries such as railroads. Munger said Saturday that avoiding Silicon Valley investments made sense for the pair, with some exceptions.We avoided the tech stocks because we felt we had no advantage there, and other people did. And I think thats a good idea not to play where the other people are better, Munger said. But, you know, if you ask me in retrospect, What was our worstmistakeinthe tech field? I think we were smart enough to figure out Google. The stock of Alphabet Inc., the parent of Google, has advanced 20 percent this year, and its co-founders became two of the richest people in the world. Buffett said Berkshires Geico unit was an early customer of Google, paying the search-engine company when people clicked on the auto insurers ads. Given the price that Geico was paying per click, Buffett said, he should have seen the technology companys promise.I had plenty of ways to ask questions, or anything of the sort, and educate myself, Buffett said. But I blew it. He also said he missed an opportunity by failing to invest in Amazon.com Inc.',\n",

What atfirstglance appeared to be a positive story very quickly divulged into a financial nightmare. Shares in the cloud communications company have fallen 30 percent in after-hours trading, attributable to lower than anticipated guidance. On the earnings call, CEO Jeff Lawson addressed the unexpected guidance by explaining that Uber, one of Twilios largest customers, will be reducing its use of Twilio over the next year. This is a major hit for the company because Uber accounted for 12 percent of its revenue in this quarter. Twilio expects this number to fall off over the next year as Uber moves away from Twilio as its principle communication infrastructure provider. Outside of guidance, Twilio reported revenue of $87.4 million with a loss of 4 cents in non-GAAP earnings per share for its Q1 2017 earnings report. This overshot analyst expectations of $83.6 million in revenue by $3.8 million and nicely beat expected non-GAAP losses of six cents per share.Twilio has long struggled with its customer concentration and it just came back to bite them. Large clients like WhatsApp and Uber have historically made up large portions of the companys revenue, causing some on Wall Street anxiety. But while Twilio has been moving to diversify its sources of revenue, a single customer, in thiscaseUber, was still able to extract almost a billion dollars in market value from the public company.',\n",

       "{0: b\"Thanks! or Thanks.? Google will tailor suggested email replies to your preferences.If you use Google's Gmail app, you may have seen something new pop up on your screen this week: suggested responses for your emails.The move illustrates one way that Google is using its increased focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. If you're wondering why and how Google can make these suggestions, here are some answers about the feature and how it works. Google calls the feature Smart Reply, and its pretty much what it sounds like. Google algorithms are scanning your messages and using the information it gleans to suggest ways that you could reply to any given message. Smart Reply relies on machine learning to scan the subject line and body of an email and make suggestions based on what it sees. The company said it has built up a huge bank of anonymized customer messages and response decisions to help accomplish this.It is also designed to remember your individual preferences for things, such as punctuation. So it will be able to adjust its suggestions depending on whether you're a Thanks! or Thanks. type of person.Smart Replies won't appear on every email though, Google said. You're most likely to see response suggestions on emails that can be easily answered with a simple sentence or two.Uber Engineer Barred From Work on Key Self-Driving Technology, Judge Says:Uber, the ride-hailing company, sidestepped a full shutdown of its self-driving car efforts on Monday when a federal judge stopped short of issuing a temporary injunction against the program.But the court mandated that Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer leading the program, be prohibited from working on a critical component of autonomous vehicle technology for the duration of the litigation, a setback that could hamper Ubers development efforts.The decision was in a case that has underlined the increasingly bitter fight between Uber andWaymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Googles parent company. The companies have been competing in the development of autonomous vehicles, which many consider the future of transportation. The outcome of the case may affect who wins or loses in the technology, which has also drawn other tech companies,automakersand start-ups. In the ruling on Monday, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco, said, WaymoL.L.C. has shown compelling evidence that its former star engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 confidential files fromWaymoimmediately before leaving his employment there.He added, Significantly, the evidence indicates that, during the acquisition, Uber likely knew or at least should have known that Levandowski had taken and retained possession ofWaymosconfidential files.Judge Alsup also ruled thatWaymosignificantly overreached when it asked for protection on more than 120 patents it called trade secrets.General approaches dictated by well-known principles of physics, however, are not secret, since they consist essentially of general engineering principles that are simply part of the intellectual equipment of technical employees, Judge Alsup wrote. He directed Uber to produce a timeline of the events leading to Mr. Levandowskis hiring, including all oral and written discussions between the parties about an important self-driving technology called lidar, short for light detection and ranging, which Mr. Levandowski has been accused of stealing. The judge also ordered Uber to do what it could to ensure the return of the files toWaymo, including the possibility of terminating Mr. Levandowskis employment at Uber.Despite the judges ruling on Mr. Levandowski, Uber also had cause for celebration because its self-driving research program was not shut down, which would have been a more serious blow.Alphabets self-driving unitWaymois teaming up withLyft:Waymo, the self-driving unit of Google parent company Alphabet, is teaming up with Lyft to work on bringing autonomous vehicle efforts to market, the New York Times reports. Details on what this partnership entails remain a little fuzzy, but sources told Times reporter Mike Isaac the two companies would be working together on pilot projects and product development efforts. That's another way of saying Lyft users in some markets will likely be able to hail aWaymoself-driving car in a limited test sometime down the road. This is not Lyfts only partnership aimed at bringing self-driving technology into the mainstream. Lyft has a partnership with GM, which last year acquired self-driving startup Cruise.Alphabetwas also experimenting with its own ride-hailing app  which the company has been using in its first pilot program in Arizona. But it's not likely the company would solely depend on either that app or the ride-matching service Waze, another Alphabet subsidiary, has been experimenting with to give consumers access to self-driving cars. Thats largely due to the difficulty of gaining market share in the already crowded ride-hail industry  an issue Lyft, the perennialrunner upto Uber, knows all too well. The relationship between Uber and Alphabet has gone from tense to combative in the past year. It was long-rumored that the two players would work together onan networkof autonomous cars but Uber decided to navigate that road on its own making a competitor of Alphabet as both companiesvyedfor automaker partnerships. This is just the latest in a series of blows to Ubers andWaymosonce potentially fruitful relationship.The Risk in Using a Public Phone Charger:Can a phone really get hacked by plugging it into a public USB charging station?A. If you have ever backed up your phones contents by plugging into the computer, you have seen how the USB port can transfer data as well as charge the devices battery. The concept of juice-jacking has been proved at hacker conventions and seen in the wild, and it is definitely possible to transfer malicious software with a phone through a USB connection  perhaps from a computer or device concealed within a public charging station, like those found in airports or malls.If you are traveling and are concerned about keeping your phones battery charged, bring your own USB cable and AC adapter so you can plug right into a regular power outlet. The Wirecutter, aproduct-recommendationsite owned by The Times, has suggestions for USB battery packs to bring along when you expect to be away from an outlet for long periods of time. Other solutions for protecting your phone include taking (or making) a power-only USB cable that lacks the internal wiring needed to transfer data. If you do not have one of those cables, power off the device before you plug it into a public charging port (although this is not a foolproof solution for every phone model out there).Last year, the Federal Trade Commission warned consumers against connecting a personal smartphone to the entertainment system through a USB port or Bluetooth wireless link in a rental car. This is because the dashboard software can import and store data from your phone, like your call logs, messages, contacts and locations you requested from the GPS software.Amazon adds video calling with Echo Show:Amazon.com Inc launched Echo Show, a touchscreen device that will allow users to video call and watch clips from CNN, the latest in the company's series of popular Echo voice-controlled speakers.The device, which will go on sale in June for about $230, will feature Alexa, Amazon's voice-controlled aide, that can be used to play music, order an Uber or turn on the house lights.Echo Show will allow video conferencing between users having an Echo device or the Alexa app. It is the first to support the feature, which is absent in similar devices offered by rivals such as Alphabet Inc's unit Google.Snapchat has almost as many teens as Facebook, despite being an eighth of its size:Snapchats narrative has consistently been one of quality over quantity.Unlike Facebook, it isnt aiming to sign up the whole world, but rather those in developed nations with expensive smartphones. Instead of focusing on huge subscriber numbers, Snapchat parent Snap touts its fervent user base. Its daily active users visit the app more than 18 times each day, according to its S-1 filing.Most importantly to a company that relies on ads for revenue, Snapchat bills itself as an app for the young  catnip for advertisers trying to reach hard-to-find millennials.Ahead of its first quarterly earnings report since going public in March, just how popular is Snapchat among young people? Not as popular as Facebook, but very impressive considering how much smaller it is. According to data from research firm eMarketer, 59 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds, 68 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds and 42 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds use the app at least once per month each month throughout the year.Facebooks numbers for those age groups are 64, 77 and 81 percent, respectively. Facebook has 1.3 billion daily active users while Snapchat has just an eighth of that at 158 million.Instagram, too, boasts a lot of users in those young age groups, though Snapchat has a much tighter hold on 12- to 17-year-old future consumers than Facebooks Instagram nearly four times as many. And again, Instagram is more than twice as big with 400 million daily active users.Amazon sweeps U.S. market for voice-controlled speakers: study.Amazon.com Inc is dominating the nascent market for voice-controlled speakers, research firm eMarketer said on Monday.The e-commerce giant's Amazon Echo and Echo Dot devices will claim a 70.6 percent share of the U.S. market this year, the study found. The speakers feature Alexa, Amazon's voice-controlled aide, which users can tell to play music, order an Uber or turn on the house lights.That puts it far ahead of Alphabet Inc's Google Home, a similar gadget that has a 23.8 percent share, and less successful offerings from other tech companies. The number of active U.S. users will more than double for the devices this year, to 35.6 million, eMarketer said.The report underscores Amazon's progress in making Alexa and its speech-recognition technology an integral part of customers' lives. More usersmeansmore data that can improve Alexa's understanding and could make it a top platform forvoice,like Windows is fordesktop.Amazon does not disclose Echo sales figures but has said it had trouble keeping the product in stock. Device sales and extra revenue from shoppers placing orders via Alexa could generate $10 billion for Amazon by 2020, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a recent note. And that does not include potential revenue from others using Alexa as a platform. Google's share is expected to grow, though. Tests by analysts have shown the technology underpinning the Google Home to match or be superior to competitors. A survey by Mahaney found the device's brand awareness in the United States already equaled 80 percent of Alexa's, despite being on the market for fewer months.Buffett Says His IBM Thesis Was Flawed, He Blew It on Google:Warren Buffett, who long shunned investments in technology stocks and then made an ill-fated bet on IBM, said that mistake shouldnt discourage wagers on the broader industry.I thought it would do better in the six years that have elapsed than it has, Buffett said of International Business Machines Corp. Saturday, at the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. And Apple, I regard them as being in a quite different business. I think Apple is much more of a consumer-products business with skill at finding opportunities that are difficult for rivals to duplicate.Apple Inc. has become one of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshires largest holdings, valued at about $19.2 billion as of March 31. The billionaire said this week that he cut about a third of his stake in IBM, sending the shares down 2.5 percent Friday.Buffett and Vice Chairman Charles Munger built Berkshire into one of the worlds largest companies with bets on consumer-product companies like Coca-Cola Co. and older industries such as railroads. Munger said Saturday that avoiding Silicon Valley investments made sense for the pair, with some exceptions.We avoided the tech stocks because we felt we had no advantage there, and other people did. And I think thats a good idea not to play where the other people are better, Munger said. But, you know, if you ask me in retrospect, What was our worstmistakeinthe tech field? I think we were smart enough to figure out Google. The stock of Alphabet Inc., the parent of Google, has advanced 20 percent this year, and its co-founders became two of the richest people in the world. Buffett said Berkshires Geico unit was an early customer of Google, paying the search-engine company when people clicked on the auto insurers ads. Given the price that Geico was paying per click, Buffett said, he should have seen the technology companys promise.I had plenty of ways to ask questions, or anything of the sort, and educate myself, Buffett said. But I blew it. He also said he missed an opportunity by failing to invest in Amazon.com Inc.Infosys, an Indian Outsourcing Company, Says It Will Create 10,000 U.S. Jobs:Facing new corporate demands and political pressure from a Trump administration that wants to curb immigrant work visas, Infosys, one of Indias leading tech outsourcing companies, said Tuesday that it will hire up to 10,000 Americans to serve its clients in the United States.The move makes Infosys the latest Asian technology company to portray itself as a jobs creator as President Trump threatens to take action against companies he sees as hurting American workers.Last month, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing government agencies to review employment immigration laws to promote Hire American policies. That included offering suggestions for how to reform the H-1B visa program, which operates as a lottery to bring skilled foreign laborers to the United States each year  usually tech workers.But Infosys is also making its move to hire American driven by other forces. Its home base of India has become a less appealing place to do the grunt work of programming as wages rise there and skilled labor has become more difficult to find. A study of 36,000 engineering students at 500 Indian colleges released last month found that only 5 percent could write software code correctly.Google success in U.S. schools forces Microsoft, Apple to scramble:Microsoft Corp's announcement of a suite of new education products on Tuesday shows the company's determination to reverse a major shift that has taken place in U.S. classrooms in recent years: for most educators and school districts, Google's Chromebook is now the computer of choice.The Chromebook has gone from a standing start in 2011 to wild popularity in the market for education technology, which tech companies have traditionally viewed as a critical way to win over the next generation of users.\",\n",
       " 1: b'SoftBank\\'s $100 Billion Tech Fund Rankles VCs as Valuations Soar:In the months since Softbank Group Corp. unveiled plans for a $100 billion technology fund, the Japanese company has been making its presence deeply felt across the industry. The Vision Fund closed a few days ago with $93 billion in initial commitments, and already venture firms from London to Silicon Valley are fretting about a behemoth with the resources,cloutand name recognition to snatch away the most promising deals. Just last week, SoftBank swooped in and pumped $1.4 billion into Paytm, Indias largestdigital-paymentsstartup. The deal boosted Paytm\\'s valuation by about 40 percent to $7 billion. That\\'s not outlandish givenPaytm\\'sdominant market position, but the valuations of other SoftBank deals have prompted head-scratching and ignited alarm that a funding atmosphere that only recently cooled off will heat up again. there\\'s the concern that SoftBank will ladle out more money than startups need or can absorb. Already founders approached by SoftBank are caught between the desire to take the money and concern about handing over too much control of their company, according to an investor. One startup targeted by SoftBank has tried to negotiate for less money, this person says. SoftBank won\\'t budge; it\\'s a big check or nothing. SoFi originally asked for less money, too, according to another investor. Pushing startups to take more cash than they ask for has been Son\\'s strategy since the beginning. SoftBank invested more money in Yahoo,Alibabaand Didi than what the entrepreneurs had initially wanted.Quora tests video answers to steal Q&A from YouTube:Newly-minted unicorn Quora has even bigger ambitions than text questions-and-answers. And its not going to let video giants or startups disrupt its future.This week Quora began testing video answers, because sometimes its a lot easier to show someone how something works, the best way to complete a task, or why one thing is better than another than try to write it out for them. Users in the beta group will be able to record videos on iOS or Android as supplements or complete answers that everyone on Quora can watch. Its considering allowing video uploads, which might offer more polished content but increase spam concerns. Previously, Quora only let users answer with text, natively hosted photos, links, and embedded videos from platforms like YouTube. Now its actively hosting and soliciting video uploads. Quoras entry intothe spacecould box out younger competitors like Justin Kans mobile video Q&A app Whale, and video Ask Me AnythingappYam. These apps are focused entirely on simplifying the process of recording video answers to questions with features like filters to make you look better, and both give creators ways to earn money.But Quoras 190 million users, $226 million in funding, and 8-year headstartgive it a big edge. Its been cautiously curating a network of experts andcontent,while building a brand name known for quality in contrast to its predecessor Yahoo Answers. Its network effect may be tough to break.LeEco employees are being called to a Tuesday meeting, and massive layoffs are expected:LeEco, a Chinese company that made a big splash in the U.S. last fall, is preparing for a round of layoffs that may happen as soon as Tuesday, according to sources.Two people told CNBC the company is planning massive layoffs in the U.S., with one source saying that only 60 employees will be left after the cut. The company\\'s current headcount in the U.S. is over 500, according to this person. LeEco started out in China as a streaming media provider  it has been referred to as the \"Netflix of China\"  and looked to expand into the US by selling affordable hardware that linked consumers to media content from LeEco\\'s partners. Its first batch of products included two smartphones and several TVs, all of which offered flagship-level specs at affordable prices. The idea, it seemed, was that LeEco would make its money back when consumers tuned in to partner programming. When it made its debut in the US in October 2016, it also promised more, including VR headsets and an electric bicycle.Why Did a Chinese Peroxide Company Pay $1 Billion for a Talking Cat?Even by the opaque standards of Chinese mergers and acquisitions, the deal was a head-scratcher. Its hard to see the synergies between a maker of chemical solvents and a digital cat perched over a toilet. And curiously, the buyer, which had recently been renamed Zhejiang Jinke Entertainment Culture Co., had revenue of only $133 million in 2016, according to Bloomberg data pulled from regulatory filings, and its gross profit was $55 million.Jinkewont say where the money to buy Outfit7 came from. Talking Tom is not alone. Theres been a recent flurry of oddball pairings between Chinese industrial interests and Western entertainment companies. A real estate magnate in Beijing bought Legendary Entertainment, the movie studio that made the Dark Knight trilogy, for $3.5 billion. A maker of construction materials bought Framestore, the company behind the special effects in the Harry Potter films. Zhejiang Dragon Pipe Manufacturing Co. acquired app developer Entertainment Game Labs. And perhaps strangest of all, Digital Extremes Ltd., which created an alien battle game, and the studio Splash Damage Ltd., which made an offshoot of the Xbox hit Gears of War, were bought by an enormous Chinese poultry processor.According to CODE Advisors LLC, an investment bank that specializes in media and technology deals, 70 percent of all acquisitions of game companies since 2015 have been by Chinese buyers. Samo, for one, isnt stopping to ask questions. A vegan, hes using his windfall to start a food-sustainability foundation. Its not easy, he says, to find buyers for a $1 billion company. The deal activity can best be understood as a consequence of quirks in the Chinese stock market. In China, industrial companies trade at valuations theyd never receive elsewhere in the world. Affan Butt, an investment banker who helped facilitate the sale of Jagex, says some may trade at as much as 100 times their annual earningsmore than four times the multiple of General Electric Co. This means they can acquire companies at what is effectively a discount. A target like Jagex is worth more once its part of a Chinese-listed company, allowing the acquirer to pay prices that appear bafflingly high to the rest of the world.Softbank-Saudi tech fund becomes world\\'s biggest with $93 billion of capital:The world\\'s largest private equity fund, backed by Japan\\'s Softbank Group and Saudi Arabia\\'s main sovereign wealth fund, said on Saturday it had raised over $93 billion to invest in technology sectors such as artificial intelligence and robotics. Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, chairman of Softbank, a telecommunications and tech investment group, revealed plans for the fund last October and since then it has obtained commitments from some of the world\\'s most deep-pocketed investors. In addition to Softbank and Saudi Arabia\\'s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the new fund\\'s investors include Abu Dhabi\\'s Mubadala Investment, which has committed $15 billion, Apple Inc, Qualcomm, Taiwan\\'s Foxconn Technology and Japan\\'s Sharp Corp.The new fund made its announcement during the visit of President Donald Trump to Riyadh and the signing of tens of billions of dollars worth of business deals between U.S. and Saudi companies. Son was also in Riyadh on Saturday.After meeting with Trump last December, Son pledged $50 billion of investment in the United States that would create 50,000 jobs, a promise Trump claimed was a direct result of his election win.The fund may also serve the interests of Saudi Arabia by helping Riyadh obtain access to foreign technology. The Saudi economy has been severely damaged by low oil prices, and policymakers are trying to diversify into new industries.Alibaba Profit Lags Estimates on Tax as Sales Defy Slowdown:Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.s earnings lagged estimates after it swallowed a higher tax bill and splurged on the entertainment and cloud computing businesses that are fueling revenue growth. The shares dropped the most in almost a year.Chinas biggest e-commerce company posted adjusted earnings-per-share of 4.35 yuan, missing the 4.51 yuan average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That came even as revenue rose at a faster-than-expected 60 percent to 38.6 billion yuan ($5.6 billion). Core commerce revenue surged 47 percent to 31.57 billion yuan with the business delivering operating income of 16.5 billion yuan, the company said.While cloud unit revenue doubled in the March quarter to 2.2 billion yuan, the business had an operating loss of 505 million yuan as it slashes prices to snatch market share from Amazon.com Inc. and Tencent. Revenue from digital entertainment more than tripled to 3.9 billion yuan with an operating loss of 2.6 billion yuan as it spends on content for video site Youku Tudou and other platforms. Income tax expenses soared 149 percent to 4.6 billion yuan in the March quarter. Its effective tax rate climbed to 29 percent from 23 percent a year earlier.Paytm raises $1.4 billion from SoftBank, valuation soars to $7 billion:Paytm has raised $1.4 billion from SoftBank Group Corp. in the largest funding round by a single investor in India, making the digital payments firm the Japanese companys biggest bet in Indias start-up ecosystem. The deal includes $400 million worth of shares that SoftBank will buy largely from Paytms early investor SAIF Partners in a secondary transaction, and a minor stake from founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma, according to two persons close to the development.The deal values the company at about $7 billion post-money (including the investment) and will take SoftBanks stake to about 20%, the two people said, requesting anonymity. Paytm, Indias second-most valuable internet firm, will use the money to acquire 500 million new customers and launch a slew of financial services products such as wealth management, insurance and deposits and loans.This business will require a lot of capital before it can start generating cash and hence we need long-term investors like SoftBank and Alibaba, founder Sharma said in a telephone interview.Cisco revenue forecast disappoints; says to cut 1,100 more jobs:Cisco forecast current-quarter revenue that widely missed analysts\\' estimates and said it would cut 1,100 more jobs, as the world\\'s largest networking gear maker steps up efforts to transform into a software-focused company.Shares of the Dow component fell 8.2 percent to $31.05 in after-market trading on Wednesday. The stock had closed down 1.4 percent in regular trading, compared with the 1.78 percent slump in the index. Revenue in its closely-watched security business, which offers firewall protection and breach detection systems, rose 9 percent to $527 million, but missed analysts\\' estimate of $545.5 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet Street Account. Cisco, like other legacy technology players, is shifting its focus to high-growth areas such as security, the Internet of Things and cloud computing, amid intense competition from companies such as Huawei and Juniper.The company\\'s net income rose to $2.52 billion, or 50 cents per share, in the third quarter ended April 29 from $2.35 billion, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier.Revenue fell 0.5 percent to $11.94 billion.Netmarble Soars as Koreas Biggest IPO in Seven Years Takes Wing:Netmarble Games Corp. jumped as investors pursuing a high-growth alternative to traditional industry piled into South Koreas biggest coming-out party in seven years.Shares in the mobile game developer and publisher climbed as high as 171,500 won in early Seoul trade, 9.2 percent above their initial public offering price, to give the company a market value of more than 14 trillion won ($12.5 billion), surpassing LG Electronics Inc. Founded in 2000 by high-school dropout Bang Jun-hyuk, Netmarble is a rare entrepreneurial success in a nation dominated by politically connected manufacturing conglomerates. Betting smartphones would drive gaming, Bang built the company into one of Asias largest publishers of mobile titles such as Lineage 2Revolution,and won backing from Chinas Tencent Holdings Ltd. A successful debut could inspire a generation of talent in a country whose conglomerates have been accused of stifling innovation. Investors bought in despite the stock trading at valuations well above its rivals: Netmarble was priced at more than 70 times 2016 earnings, surpassing NCSoft Corp.s roughly 29 times and Nexon Co.s 45 times as of Thursdays close. It also faces stiffening competition, with NCSoft releasing a role-playing series this year to directly challenge Lineage 2 Revolution.How Australia Bungled Its $36 Billion High-Speed Internet Rollout:Australia, a wealthy nation with a widely envied quality of life, lags in one essential area of modern life: its internet speed. Eight years after the country began an unprecedented broadband modernization effort that will cost at least 49 billion Australian dollars, or $36 billion, its average internet speed lags that of the United States, most of Western Europe, Japan and South Korea. In the most recent ranking of internet speeds by Akamai, a networking company, Australia came in at an embarrassing No. 51, trailing developing economies like Thailand and Kenya.Australia was the first country where a totally national plan to cover every house or business was considered, said Rod Tucker, a University of Melbourne professor and a member of the expert panel that advised on the effort. The fact it was a government plan didnt necessarily make it doomed. In Australia, we have changes of governments every three years, which really works against the ability to undertake long-term planning, and the long-term rollouts of networks like this.Australia poses natural connectivity challenges. It lies oceans away from other countries, and any network would have to connect far-flung cities separated by its sparsely populated interior.Still, Australia had high hopes for its ambitious internet project. Started in 2009, the initiative, known as the National Broadband Network, was intended to bring advanced fiber-optic technology to the doorstep of just about every home and business. It was initially estimated to cost 43 billion Australian dollars, shared by the government and the private sector. But the government share of those costs quickly climbed until taxpayers were responsible for all of it. The technology was slow to roll out, in part because of negotiations with Telstra, Australias big telecommunications provider, over installing the fiber. (A Telstra spokesman said the company did not believe the talks added to delays.) The government-funded effort drew fire from the Liberal Party, the opposition at the time, which said the job should have been left to the private sector.After a Liberal-led coalition was elected in 2013, that party looked for ways to contain costs and speed up the rollout. They focused on what in the telecommunications industry is called the last mile  the wires that connect a home or business with the broader network. While the National Broadband Network initially envisioned high-speed fiber connecting homes and businesses directly to the network, the Liberal-led effort compromised by connecting them with existing copper wire  basically, the same technology used in the earliest days of the telephone. The result, critics say, was slow speeds that still did not stop rising costs.Snap shares plummet as investors mark down first earnings report:Shares tumbled 23 percent in after-hours trading to wipe some $6 billion from Snap\\'s market value, a humbling reversal for the company after its red-hot March initial public offering, which was the biggest for a U.S. tech company since Facebook Inc in 2012.The stock fell to $17.66, only just above its IPO price of $17.Snap\\'s revenue jumped nearly four-fold year-over-year to $149.6 million but fell short of the average analyst forecast of $158 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was also down from the fourth quarter of 2016, a seasonally stronger period for adsales,when it was $166 million.Revenue was \"a relatively disappointing number,\" Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said. \"To their credit,\" he added, \"they did guide towards a number that would be lower, which it was.\"Average revenue per user was 90 cents in the first quarter, Snap said, up from 33 cents the same quarter a year earlier but below the $1.05 per user in the fourth quarter of 2016.Snap\\'s net loss widened to $2.21 billion, or $2.31 per share, in the first quarter, from $104.6 million, or 14 cents per share, due to stock-based compensation related to the IPO.Although the figure of $2 billion in total stock-based compensation was known ahead of time, investors were surprised to see all of it show up in a single quarter rather than spread out over time, said Eric Kim, managing partner at Goodwater Capital.\"It is an eye-popping number for sure,\" he said.Yelp is getting eviscerated after it toned down its expectations for the year:Yelp shares are down more than 25 percent after the company reported its first-quarter earnings report today, where it reduced its full-year guidance that it set in the previous quarter.The company said it would bring in between $850 million and $865 million in revenue for the full fiscal year of 2017. In the fourth quarter (reported in February), Yelp said net revenue was expected to be in the range of $880 million to $900 million. That means even though the companys revenue fell only a little short of what Wall Street was expecting, the company is signaling slower growth than expected. Yelp has seen slowing revenue growth for some time now. If the company itself isparingback its growth expectations, that means its trying to set some model closer to reality for Wall Street  which is inevitably going to make industry observers reset their ownmodels,and the valuation for the company along with it. Before todays fall off a cliff, Yelp was valued at around $2.8 billion.Candid, Comedic and Macabre YouTube Stars Feel an Advertising Pinch:Tim Wood sat on a chair inside a house in Hinsdale, N.Y., long rumored to be haunted. He hada Ouijaboard in his lap and waslivestreamingthe experience to a group of fans on YouTube. Youre not ever supposed to do Ouija alone, let alone in a place that had an exorcism done in it, he said to the empty room. As he filmed last month, the comments rolled in, some admiring (You are one brave ghost hunter), others fearing for his safety (Tim, dont summon what u cant banish). Mr. Wood, 39, has amassed a small but loyal following by making online videos of ghost hunts and paranormal activity, using YouTube to broadcast his work since about 2013. Automatically placed advertisements on his channel, LiveScifi, which has about 470,000 subscribers, have allowed him to turn the videos into a full-time job.But in the wake of a recent advertiser exodus from YouTube, prompted by major brands discovering they were showing up on videos promoting hate speech and terrorism, his earnings have plunged. Mr. Wood, who lives in San Francisco with his fiance and their infant, said his channel had brought in at least $6,000 a month in revenue last year  which helped pay for travel to site locations, the production of his videos and his other day-to-day bills. In January, his estimated revenue was about $3,900. In February and March, he was alarmed to see that drop below $3,000. Last month, he saw around $1,600 and has been using crowdfunding to cover his shooting costs.In February and March, a slew of advertisers yanked their money from the platform, prompting YouTube to tighten its default settings for where ads appear and to offer new ways for brands to manually and automatically avoid material that violates its guidelines. Rates are a lot lower and hurting a lot of folks, said Krishna Subramanian, a founder of Captiv8, a firm that connects brands to social media influencers. His firm recently conducted a survey of 100 YouTube creators and said that channels focused on comedy and gaming experienced the sharpest drops in revenue last month compared with February. At the same time, creators in food,beautyand fashion, and family and parenting hadincreases. YouTube shares ad revenue with creators, who keep more than half.Some creators are looking at a video saying, It got a million views, but I only got $700  I used to get $2,500, Mr. Subramanian said.Facebook shares dip from high as investors fret over costs, future profit:Facebook Inc reported surging quarterly profit and revenue on Wednesday, helped by its fast-growing mobile ad business, but its shares dipped from a record high in after-hours trading as investors showed some nervousness about future earnings.The world\\'s biggest online social network, which is nearing the five-year anniversary of its initial public offering, is searching for new types of advertising features to supplement its main revenue streams that it expects to cool off this year.Facebook\\'s shares fell 2.4 percent in after-hours trading to $148.12. They had closed at an all-time high of $153.60 on Tuesday.Facebook said quarterly profit in the first three months of 2017 rose 76.6 percentyear-over yearto $3.06 billion and total revenue went up 49 percent to $8.03 billion.That would give Facebook a 22.6 percent share of the worldwide mobile ad market, with archrival Google of Alphabet Inc projected to be the leader with a 35.1 percent share, according to eMarketer.Teslas Q1 revenue more than doubles year-over-year as Model 3 plan remains on track:Tesla reported a loss of $1.33 per share on revenue of $2.7 billion, while Wall Street expected a loss of 83 cents per share on $2.61 billion in revenue. While it was a wider-than-expected loss, it looks like a pretty ho-hum result for the company as all eyes look toward the later part of the year when the Model 3 production is in full swing  and whether Tesla will be able to get enough cars rolling out.In April, Teslas continued rising stock price valued the company more than Ford. That came on the heels of the company saying its vehicle production and deliveries rose in the first quarter at a rate faster than what Wall Street expected. Shares of Tesla were largely unchanged today, with the company worth more than $50 billion (still well above Ford).Fitbit Beats Low Expectations on Stronger-Than-Expected Demand:Fitbit gave investors some much-needed good news, reporting revenue that beat projections and suggesting its finally making progress in its transformation from a maker of step-counting gadgets to essential health-monitoring tools.The hardware makers profitability has sagged while it confronts a maturing market and falling sales. Fitbit shares have lost more than half of their value over the past year, as investors lost patience that upcoming products would resuscitate demand. The company reported earnings that came in well-below analyst expectations the past two quarters and cut staff earlier this year to reduce operating costs.Sales fell 41 percent to $298.9 million in the quarter ended March 31, Fitbit said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts on average estimated $279.4 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company said it lost 15 cents a share, excluding some costs, compared with analysts projection of a loss of 18 cents a share.Fitbits share gained 9.3 percent in extended trading at 4:28 p.m. in New York after closing at $5.68.Square Thrives as Payments Platform Woos Bigger Merchants:Square Inc. is on a roll, proving that its not just a niche payments player but an all-inclusive business management platform for small companies.Run by Twitter Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey, Square has come a long way from its early days as a credit card reader in food trucks. Its been expanding geographically and in terms of theservicesit offers merchants, winning bigger clients as a result and boosting sales. Revenue in the first quarter shot past forecasts from the company and analysts, rising 39 percent as businesses sign on for payments processing,loansand software to help manage inventory. Square also raised its sales and profit forecast for the year.Not long ago investors had begun to question Squares prospects and growth in the face of rising competition from PayPal Holdings Inc. and Apple Pay. But the San Francisco-based company has plowed ahead, marking its biggest international push by launching services in the U.K. in March, and signing partnerships and acquisitions in the food-delivery business, a strategy it hopes helps attract more restaurants. Earlier this year, Square introduced a set of business tools aimed specifically at retailers, which accounted for 20 percent of all payments volume it processed last year.The efforts havent gone unnoticed, as investors pushed the stock to a record $18.81 on Tuesday. Square gained 5.4 percent at 5:28 p.m. in extended trading in New York Wednesday.Apple Sells Fewer iPhones in Last Quarter, Shares Slide:Apple Inc. reported falling iPhone sales, highlighting the need to deliver blockbuster new features in the next edition of the flagship device if the company is to fend off rivals like Samsung. Investor confidence has been mounting ahead of a major iPhonerevampduelater this year. Yet competitors released new high-end smartphones recently, putting pressure on Apple to deliver a device thats advanced enough to entice existing users to upgrade and lure new customers. Apple sold 50.8 million iPhones in the quarter ended April 1, down from 51.2 million units in the same period a year earlier, and less than the 51.4 million predicted in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Apple stock slipped almost 2 percent in extended trading. The Cupertino, California-based company also forecast $43.5 billion to $45.5 billion in revenue for the current quarter. China revenue fell 14 percent. Cook has repeatedly sought to highlight Apples services, the fastest growing part of the company last year. Sales of offerings like iCloud, the AppStoreand Apple Music grew 18 percent to $7.04 billion in the quarter.Etsy Replaces CEO, Plans to Cut 8% of Jobs to Reduce Costs:Etsy Inc. named director Josh Silverman as chief executive officer, replacing Chad Dickerson, and said its cutting 8 percent of its workforce as it copes with slowing sales growth. The shares tumbled as much as 21 percent. Etsy also reported first-quarter revenue of $96.9 million, missing analysts average estimates. Though sales gained 18 percent, it was the companys fourth straight period of slowing growth. The stock dropped as low as $8.96 in extended trading after news of the executive change and earnings report.Twilio stock plummets as major client Uber distances itself:A good report on revenue wasnt enough to keep Twilio stock from taking a dive in after-hours trading. What atfirstglance appeared to be a positive story very quickly divulged into a financial nightmare. Shares in the cloud communications company have fallen 30 percent in after-hours trading, attributable to lower than anticipated guidance. On the earnings call, CEO Jeff Lawson addressed the unexpected guidance by explaining that Uber, one of Twilios largest customers, will be reducing its use of Twilio over the next year. This is a major hit for the company because Uber accounted for 12 percent of its revenue in this quarter. Twilio expects this number to fall off over the next year as Uber moves away from Twilio as its principle communication infrastructure provider. Outside of guidance, Twilio reported revenue of $87.4 million with a loss of 4 cents in non-GAAP earnings per share for its Q1 2017 earnings report. This overshot analyst expectations of $83.6 million in revenue by $3.8 million and nicely beat expected non-GAAP losses of six cents per share.Twilio has long struggled with its customer concentration and it just came back to bite them. Large clients like WhatsApp and Uber have historically made up large portions of the companys revenue, causing some on Wall Street anxiety. But while Twilio has been moving to diversify its sources of revenue, a single customer, in thiscaseUber, was still able to extract almost a billion dollars in market value from the public company.',\n",
       " 2: b'Pittsburgh Welcomed Ubers Driverless Car Experiment.Not Anymore. When Uber picked this former Rust Belt town as the inaugural city for its driverless car experiment, Pittsburgh played the consummate host.You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet, Bill Peduto, the mayor of Pittsburgh, said in September. If you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet.Nine months later, Pittsburgh residents and officials say Uber has not lived up to its end of the bargain. Among Ubers perceived transgressions: The company began charging for driverless rides that were initially pitched as free. It also withdrew support from Pittsburghs application for a $50 million federal grant to revamp transportation. And it has not created the jobs it proposed in a struggling neighborhood that houses its autonomous car testing track. The deteriorating relationship between Pittsburgh and Uber offers a cautionary tale, especially as other cities consider rolling out driverless car trials from Uber, AlphabetsWaymoand others.Walmart Reports 63% Rise in Online Sales:On Thursday, the company said e-commerce sales had grown 63 percent in the United States in the latest quarter. The unexpected leap offered the strongest evidence yet that Walmart, the countrys largest retailer, is making headway in its effort to be as prominent online as it is across the American landscape. Walmarts latest strategy, put in place by its current chief executive, Doug McMillon, has several parts: expand the number of products available online, better leverage its huge physical warehouses and distribution centers to reach customers quickly across the country, and aggressively pursue deals for online stores.The biggest of those deals, in which Walmart paid $3.3 billion for the bulk e-commerce retailer Jet.com last year, was part of the plan to offer customers more products through the web.The earnings results on Thursday gave only hints of about how much the acquisitions gave the company a one-time bump in sales, rather than long-lasting fruit from other changes the company has made. Comparable-store sales, one measure of growth that looks at stores that have been open for at least a year, rose 1.4 percent. That number includes Walmarts core online business, but not items sold through Jet.com.Walmart completed its purchase of Jet in September. Smaller digital acquisitions followed, including ModCloth, a womens clothing retailer, and the outdoor apparel site Moosejaw.The deal for Jet was also widely seen as a play for its founder, Marc Lore, a serial digital entrepreneur who could help fix Walmarts online strategy. Mr. Lore was put in charge of running Walmart.com after the acquisition, spearheading the face-off between the worlds largest brick-and-mortar retailer and its biggest online competitor.Square Will Replace Meters in Washington Taxis:Washington, D.C., is enlisting Square Inc.s help as its taxi commission tries to help the citys cabbies compete with Uber drivers. By the end of August, all of the taxis in Washington have to tear out their traditional meters and start using smartphones or tablets, in what the city government has been describing as a complete reimagining of how the cab system works.For Square, the deal reflects an increasing focus on becoming the payment platform for a range of other company\\'s mobile applications, websites and point-of-sale devices. No money is changing hands between the company and the city. Square agreed to satisfy the departments requirement that drivers give up no more than 2.65 percent of their fares in transaction fees, according to the department. Thats lower than the standard 2.75 commission it usually takes and significantly less than the 3.5 percent to 5 percent commission that drivers currently pay to use the mechanical meters, according to ErnestChrappah, the director of the city\\'s taxi regulator. Chrappah said the lower fees will help make it easier for cabbies to sustain themselves. But the bigger changes come in the increased flexibility that taxi drivers will have once theyre untethered from mechanical meters. There wont be a single taxi app. Instead, the department is asking developers to build apps, which it will then certify for use by licensed taxi drivers. It is currently working with seven developers, who will make their apps public between now the deadline to replace the meters. It will continue to consider adding new apps as developers pitch them. All of the certified apps must be able to operate as meters for street hails. Theyll also be able to provide digital receipts showing the route they took and give riders the option to rate drivers. Developers can also build services like carpooling or delivery systems that will connect drivers to local merchants looking for people to drop off food, groceries or other products. A developer could build an Uber clone, creating a way to connect drivers to passengers requesting rides through an app. The exact contours of these services will become clear as the individual developers release their software.Taxis will also be able to offer dynamic pricing, where drivers can give discounts during periods when they have trouble securing fares. This resembles Ubers practice of charging more when demand rises as a way to coax drivers onto the road, only in reverse. Drivers wont have the option to increase their fares.As self-driving cars hit the road, real estate development may takenewdirection:The much-hyped transition to autonomous cars, while still years, or even decades, away, according to experts, is an opportunity and challenge that haswidepotential to reshape our transportation systems.But many believe that as city planners, transportation officials, and, eventually, developers start grappling with the changes to come, autonomous vehicles potential to reshape real estate, development, and city planning will rival that of the introduction of the automobile. At the American Planning Associations annual conference earlier this month in New York City, the issue of autonomous vehicles and driverless cars, one admittedly far in the future, was the subject of numerous present-day panels, discussions, and debates. [An expert] sees two small but significant changes affecting urban real estate development in the age of driverless cars. A reduced need for parking may be the most significant. High-value property in urban areas needs to account for mandatory parking allowances, forcing developers to factor the cost of parking spaces into construction costs and rent. Local government will need to act decisively to regulate drop-off lanes, speeds, and new parking rules before market forces, and other governments, begin making decisions for them. Technology firms shouldnt reap the rewards after cities make the investments necessary to adapt to a new transportation reality.Hardly Anyone Paying the Hackers? Because Using Bitcoin Is Hard:An unprecedented cyberattack swept across the globe over the weekend, but so far the majority of victims havent paid hackers a ransom.After the ransomware began infecting users on Friday, they were given 72 hours to pay $300 in bitcoin -- chosen by the hackers because thecrypto currencyis harder to track than conventional payments -- or pay twice as much. If they refused to pay after seven days, their computer would be permanently locked -- a serious problem for those who havent backed up their data.As of early Monday, only about $50,000 had been paid in ransoms, according to Elliptic Enterprises Ltd., a London-based company that tracks illicit use of bitcoin. The company calculated the total based on payments tracked to bitcoin addresses specified in the ransom demands, adding that it expects the total to rise. Paying a ransom isnt like buying something from Amazon by entering their credit or debit card information. Even though the hackers provided a helpful link for those new to paying in bitcoin, thecrypto currencyis a black box for most people.\"If youre presented with something that says pay this amount in bitcoin, most people dont know where to start with that,\" said James Smith, theCEOand co-founder of Elliptic.There are several steps. First, a person or business has to obtain the bitcoins by registering with one of the various online exchanges and going through its verification process. After that, money can be deposited into the exchange. For those living in countries that dont have an exchange, including the U.K., money must be converted into another currency.Once the money is deposited on the exchange, the bitcoins can be sent to the address provided by the extortionist. \"It looks like a long garbled string of text,\" Smith said. After the fee is paid, the hackers supposedly free the affected computer.\"A large amount of bitcoin is actually somewhat difficult to source quickly,\" said Alex Sunnarborg, an analyst at bitcoin research company CoinDesk, adding it might take a few days to create an account at a bitcoin brokerage or exchange, connect a bank account, and then receive the bitcoin.One notable difference with this attack is that the perpetrators demanded a relatively small amount of money but from a large number of people, said James Chappell, chief technology officer and co-founder of U.K. security company Digital Shadows.More typically, he said, hackers demand one large ransom to unlock all the infected machines. \"Quite often theyre in the thousands rather than the hundreds of dollars,\" he said. \"It is unusual to see this piecemeal approach, computer by computer.\"Extortionists Mount Global Hacking Attack Seeking Ransom:Extortionist hackers who may be using leaked computer exploits from the U.S. National Security Agency infiltrated computers in dozens of countries in a fast-spreading attack that forced British hospitals to turn away patients and breached systems at Spains Telefonica SA and organizations from Russia to Taiwan.The ransomware used in Fridays cyber-attacks encrypts files and demands that victims pay $300 in bitcoin for them to be decrypted, the latest in a vexing style of security breaches that, at the very least, forces organizations to revert to backup systems to keep critical systems running. The malicious software has infected more than 75,000 computers in 99 countries worldwide on Friday, most of them concentrated in Russia,Ukraineand Taiwan, according to Dutch cybersecurity company Avast Software BV. While the victim tally is likely to grow, the ransomware, called WanaCrypt0r, only affects computers that havent applied Microsofts two-month-old fix, a reminder that individuals and organizations that dont routinely update their machines are vulnerable. Hospitals are notoriously slow in applying security fixes, in part because of how disruptive it is to take patient-facing equipment and databases offline. That has made them a reliable target of ransomware and identity-theft attacks, and why they routinely fall victim even to random mass attacks.As Department Stores Close, Stitch Fix Expands Online:The retail landscape is littered with the casualties of changing consumer behavior. Shoppers are bargain hunting online, department stores are struggling, and once-mainstay brands are closing out permanently.Then there is Stitch Fix, a mail-order clothing service that offers customerslittlechoice in what garments theyreceive,and shies away from discounts for brand name dresses,pantsand accessories.Despite a business model that seems to defy conventional wisdom, Stitch Fix continues to grow.For the fiscal year that ended last July, the company recorded sales of $730 million. It has been profitable since 2014 and has raised just $42 million from outside investors, a relatively modest sum for a high-flying Silicon Valley start-up.Stitch Fixs pitch is straightforward enough: Trust the company to pick out your tops, bottoms, shoes or accessories for you.When customers sign up, they fill out an extensive form detailing style preferences, clothingneedsand price points. The start-ups algorithms then churn out a set of potential choices, which one of its 3,400 stylists  most of them part time  then tailors to the individual customer before sending out five items in a package. Anything a customer does not want can be returned free of charge, and customers receive a 25 percent discount when they buy everything in the box.Stitch Fix is not the first company to try this business model. Similar start-ups, from clothing rival Trunk Club to the cosmetics specialist Birchbox, have found a market mailing consumers a grab bag of items and offering free returns for anything unwanted.But many such start-ups have had trouble keeping costs down, and customers around. Nordstrom, which bought Trunk Club in 2014 for a reported $350 million, wrote down nearly $200 million from the business value last year.VCs Put $110 Million Into Grammar-Checking Software:General Catalyst, a Silicon Valley venture firm, said Monday that it led a $110 million investment in Grammarly Inc. The San Francisco startup makes software that underlines awkward words and phrases in the users writing and makes suggestions, similar to a feature in Microsoft Word.Grammarly promises to do more than fix spelling and syntax. It said the software tailors the tone and word choice of personal or professional writing for the 6.9 million people using the tool daily, many of whom interact with the service through a web browser extension for Google Chrome. Grammarlys funding round is among the largest initial investments for a technology startup recently. The founders of Grammarly had eschewed venture capital since setting up the company in 2009. Grammarly said its business is profitable.'}"

       "b\"Thanks! or Thanks.? Google will tailor suggested email replies to your preferences.If you use Google's Gmail app, you may have seen something new pop up on your screen this week: suggested responses for your emails.The move illustrates one way that Google is using its increased focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. If you're wondering why and how Google can make these suggestions, here are some answers about the feature and how it works. Google calls the feature Smart Reply, and its pretty much what it sounds like. Google algorithms are scanning your messages and using the information it gleans to suggest ways that you could reply to any given message. Smart Reply relies on machine learning to scan the subject line and body of an email and make suggestions based on what it sees. The company said it has built up a huge bank of anonymized customer messages and response decisions to help accomplish this.It is also designed to remember your individual preferences for things, such as punctuation. So it will be able to adjust its suggestions depending on whether you're a Thanks! or Thanks. type of person.Smart Replies won't appear on every email though, Google said. You're most likely to see response suggestions on emails that can be easily answered with a simple sentence or two.Uber Engineer Barred From Work on Key Self-Driving Technology, Judge Says:Uber, the ride-hailing company, sidestepped a full shutdown of its self-driving car efforts on Monday when a federal judge stopped short of issuing a temporary injunction against the program.But the court mandated that Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer leading the program, be prohibited from working on a critical component of autonomous vehicle technology for the duration of the litigation, a setback that could hamper Ubers development efforts.The decision was in a case that has underlined the increasingly bitter fight between Uber andWaymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Googles parent company. The companies have been competing in the development of autonomous vehicles, which many consider the future of transportation. The outcome of the case may affect who wins or loses in the technology, which has also drawn other tech companies,automakersand start-ups. In the ruling on Monday, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco, said, WaymoL.L.C. has shown compelling evidence that its former star engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 confidential files fromWaymoimmediately before leaving his employment there.He added, Significantly, the evidence indicates that, during the acquisition, Uber likely knew or at least should have known that Levandowski had taken and retained possession ofWaymosconfidential files.Judge Alsup also ruled thatWaymosignificantly overreached when it asked for protection on more than 120 patents it called trade secrets.General approaches dictated by well-known principles of physics, however, are not secret, since they consist essentially of general engineering principles that are simply part of the intellectual equipment of technical employees, Judge Alsup wrote. He directed Uber to produce a timeline of the events leading to Mr. Levandowskis hiring, including all oral and written discussions between the parties about an important self-driving technology called lidar, short for light detection and ranging, which Mr. Levandowski has been accused of stealing. The judge also ordered Uber to do what it could to ensure the return of the files toWaymo, including the possibility of terminating Mr. Levandowskis employment at Uber.Despite the judges ruling on Mr. Levandowski, Uber also had cause for celebration because its self-driving research program was not shut down, which would have been a more serious blow.Alphabets self-driving unitWaymois teaming up withLyft:Waymo, the self-driving unit of Google parent company Alphabet, is teaming up with Lyft to work on bringing autonomous vehicle efforts to market, the New York Times reports. Details on what this partnership entails remain a little fuzzy, but sources told Times reporter Mike Isaac the two companies would be working together on pilot projects and product development efforts. That's another way of saying Lyft users in some markets will likely be able to hail aWaymoself-driving car in a limited test sometime down the road. This is not Lyfts only partnership aimed at bringing self-driving technology into the mainstream. Lyft has a partnership with GM, which last year acquired self-driving startup Cruise.Alphabetwas also experimenting with its own ride-hailing app  which the company has been using in its first pilot program in Arizona. But it's not likely the company would solely depend on either that app or the ride-matching service Waze, another Alphabet subsidiary, has been experimenting with to give consumers access to self-driving cars. Thats largely due to the difficulty of gaining market share in the already crowded ride-hail industry  an issue Lyft, the perennialrunner upto Uber, knows all too well. The relationship between Uber and Alphabet has gone from tense to combative in the past year. It was long-rumored that the two players would work together onan networkof autonomous cars but Uber decided to navigate that road on its own making a competitor of Alphabet as both companiesvyedfor automaker partnerships. This is just the latest in a series of blows to Ubers andWaymosonce potentially fruitful relationship.The Risk in Using a Public Phone Charger:Can a phone really get hacked by plugging it into a public USB charging station?A. If you have ever backed up your phones contents by plugging into the computer, you have seen how the USB port can transfer data as well as charge the devices battery. The concept of juice-jacking has been proved at hacker conventions and seen in the wild, and it is definitely possible to transfer malicious software with a phone through a USB connection  perhaps from a computer or device concealed within a public charging station, like those found in airports or malls.If you are traveling and are concerned about keeping your phones battery charged, bring your own USB cable and AC adapter so you can plug right into a regular power outlet. The Wirecutter, aproduct-recommendationsite owned by The Times, has suggestions for USB battery packs to bring along when you expect to be away from an outlet for long periods of time. Other solutions for protecting your phone include taking (or making) a power-only USB cable that lacks the internal wiring needed to transfer data. If you do not have one of those cables, power off the device before you plug it into a public charging port (although this is not a foolproof solution for every phone model out there).Last year, the Federal Trade Commission warned consumers against connecting a personal smartphone to the entertainment system through a USB port or Bluetooth wireless link in a rental car. This is because the dashboard software can import and store data from your phone, like your call logs, messages, contacts and locations you requested from the GPS software.Amazon adds video calling with Echo Show:Amazon.com Inc launched Echo Show, a touchscreen device that will allow users to video call and watch clips from CNN, the latest in the company's series of popular Echo voice-controlled speakers.The device, which will go on sale in June for about $230, will feature Alexa, Amazon's voice-controlled aide, that can be used to play music, order an Uber or turn on the house lights.Echo Show will allow video conferencing between users having an Echo device or the Alexa app. It is the first to support the feature, which is absent in similar devices offered by rivals such as Alphabet Inc's unit Google.Snapchat has almost as many teens as Facebook, despite being an eighth of its size:Snapchats narrative has consistently been one of quality over quantity.Unlike Facebook, it isnt aiming to sign up the whole world, but rather those in developed nations with expensive smartphones. Instead of focusing on huge subscriber numbers, Snapchat parent Snap touts its fervent user base. Its daily active users visit the app more than 18 times each day, according to its S-1 filing.Most importantly to a company that relies on ads for revenue, Snapchat bills itself as an app for the young  catnip for advertisers trying to reach hard-to-find millennials.Ahead of its first quarterly earnings report since going public in March, just how popular is Snapchat among young people? Not as popular as Facebook, but very impressive considering how much smaller it is. According to data from research firm eMarketer, 59 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds, 68 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds and 42 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds use the app at least once per month each month throughout the year.Facebooks numbers for those age groups are 64, 77 and 81 percent, respectively. Facebook has 1.3 billion daily active users while Snapchat has just an eighth of that at 158 million.Instagram, too, boasts a lot of users in those young age groups, though Snapchat has a much tighter hold on 12- to 17-year-old future consumers than Facebooks Instagram nearly four times as many. And again, Instagram is more than twice as big with 400 million daily active users.Amazon sweeps U.S. market for voice-controlled speakers: study.Amazon.com Inc is dominating the nascent market for voice-controlled speakers, research firm eMarketer said on Monday.The e-commerce giant's Amazon Echo and Echo Dot devices will claim a 70.6 percent share of the U.S. market this year, the study found. The speakers feature Alexa, Amazon's voice-controlled aide, which users can tell to play music, order an Uber or turn on the house lights.That puts it far ahead of Alphabet Inc's Google Home, a similar gadget that has a 23.8 percent share, and less successful offerings from other tech companies. The number of active U.S. users will more than double for the devices this year, to 35.6 million, eMarketer said.The report underscores Amazon's progress in making Alexa and its speech-recognition technology an integral part of customers' lives. More usersmeansmore data that can improve Alexa's understanding and could make it a top platform forvoice,like Windows is fordesktop.Amazon does not disclose Echo sales figures but has said it had trouble keeping the product in stock. Device sales and extra revenue from shoppers placing orders via Alexa could generate $10 billion for Amazon by 2020, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a recent note. And that does not include potential revenue from others using Alexa as a platform. Google's share is expected to grow, though. Tests by analysts have shown the technology underpinning the Google Home to match or be superior to competitors. A survey by Mahaney found the device's brand awareness in the United States already equaled 80 percent of Alexa's, despite being on the market for fewer months.Buffett Says His IBM Thesis Was Flawed, He Blew It on Google:Warren Buffett, who long shunned investments in technology stocks and then made an ill-fated bet on IBM, said that mistake shouldnt discourage wagers on the broader industry.I thought it would do better in the six years that have elapsed than it has, Buffett said of International Business Machines Corp. Saturday, at the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. And Apple, I regard them as being in a quite different business. I think Apple is much more of a consumer-products business with skill at finding opportunities that are difficult for rivals to duplicate.Apple Inc. has become one of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshires largest holdings, valued at about $19.2 billion as of March 31. The billionaire said this week that he cut about a third of his stake in IBM, sending the shares down 2.5 percent Friday.Buffett and Vice Chairman Charles Munger built Berkshire into one of the worlds largest companies with bets on consumer-product companies like Coca-Cola Co. and older industries such as railroads. Munger said Saturday that avoiding Silicon Valley investments made sense for the pair, with some exceptions.We avoided the tech stocks because we felt we had no advantage there, and other people did. And I think thats a good idea not to play where the other people are better, Munger said. But, you know, if you ask me in retrospect, What was our worstmistakeinthe tech field? I think we were smart enough to figure out Google. The stock of Alphabet Inc., the parent of Google, has advanced 20 percent this year, and its co-founders became two of the richest people in the world. Buffett said Berkshires Geico unit was an early customer of Google, paying the search-engine company when people clicked on the auto insurers ads. Given the price that Geico was paying per click, Buffett said, he should have seen the technology companys promise.I had plenty of ways to ask questions, or anything of the sort, and educate myself, Buffett said. But I blew it. He also said he missed an opportunity by failing to invest in Amazon.com Inc.Infosys, an Indian Outsourcing Company, Says It Will Create 10,000 U.S. Jobs:Facing new corporate demands and political pressure from a Trump administration that wants to curb immigrant work visas, Infosys, one of Indias leading tech outsourcing companies, said Tuesday that it will hire up to 10,000 Americans to serve its clients in the United States.The move makes Infosys the latest Asian technology company to portray itself as a jobs creator as President Trump threatens to take action against companies he sees as hurting American workers.Last month, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing government agencies to review employment immigration laws to promote Hire American policies. That included offering suggestions for how to reform the H-1B visa program, which operates as a lottery to bring skilled foreign laborers to the United States each year  usually tech workers.But Infosys is also making its move to hire American driven by other forces. Its home base of India has become a less appealing place to do the grunt work of programming as wages rise there and skilled labor has become more difficult to find. A study of 36,000 engineering students at 500 Indian colleges released last month found that only 5 percent could write software code correctly.Google success in U.S. schools forces Microsoft, Apple to scramble:Microsoft Corp's announcement of a suite of new education products on Tuesday shows the company's determination to reverse a major shift that has taken place in U.S. classrooms in recent years: for most educators and school districts, Google's Chromebook is now the computer of choice.The Chromebook has gone from a standing start in 2011 to wild popularity in the market for education technology, which tech companies have traditionally viewed as a critical way to win over the next generation of users.\""

Instead, he went to China. The balance of power in technology is shifting. China, which for years watched enviously as the West invented the software and the chips powering today’s digital age, has become a major player in artificial intelligence, what some think may be the most important technology of the future. Experts widely believe China is only a step behind the United States. China’s ambitions mingle the most far-out sci-fi ideas with the needs of an authoritarian state: Philip K. Dick meets George Orwell. There are plans to use it to predict crimes, lend money, track people on the country’s ubiquitous closed-circuit cameras, alleviate traffic jams, create self-guided missiles and censor the internet. Beijing is backing its artificial intelligence push with vast sums of money. Having already spent billions on research programs, China is readying a new multibillion-dollar initiative to fund moonshot projects, start-ups and academic research, all with the aim of growing China’s A.I. capabilities, according to two professors who consulted with the government on the plan. China’s private companies are pushing deeply into the field as well, though the line between government and private in China sometimes blurs. Baidu — often called the Google of China and a pioneer in artificial-intelligence-related fields, like speech recognition — this year opened a joint company-government laboratory partly run by academics who once worked on research into Chinese military robots. China is spending more just as the United States cuts back. This past week, the Trump administration released a proposed budget that would slash funding for a variety of government agencies that have traditionally backed artificial intelligence research.\""

India's most influential government think-tank unveiled a policy blueprint this month aimed at electrifying all vehicles in the country by 2032, in a move that is catching the attention of car makers that are already investing in electric technology in China such as BYD and SAIC. The May 12 report by Niti Aayog, the planning body headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, recommends lower taxes and loan interest rates on electric vehicles while capping sales of petrol and diesel cars, seen as a radical shift in policy. India also plans to impose higher taxes on hybrid vehicles compared with electric, under a new unified tax regime set to come into effect from July 1, upsetting car makers like Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Motor. Earlier this year SAIC set up a local unit called MG Motor which is finalising plans to buy a car manufacturing plant in western India. A spokesman at SAIC did not comment specifically on the company's India plans. Warren Buffett-backed BYD already builds electric buses in the country, while rival Chongqing Changan has said it may enter India by 2020.\""
